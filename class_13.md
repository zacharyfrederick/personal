# The Economics of Business
# In Earlier Episodes…a few prompts
What sort of super powers did the classical entrepreneur possess?
How did Knight distinguish risk and uncertainty?
How does Knight indicate managers deal with uncertainty?
How does the market value uncertainty?
What role is there for management if there is no uncertainty?
What ultimately limits the growth of firms in N. Kaldor, A. Robinson, A. Marshall, R. Coase and most other economists’ worlds?
What factors limit entrepreneurial or management capacity?
How does Simon define bounded rationality; how does it compare to irrationality?*
# Earlier episodes, continued
Given that complexity often overwhelms us, what sort of simplifications does Simon suggest?
Do Simon’s modified decision rules guarantee a unique solution?
What are the only two ways Simon said organizations could learn?
Is individual learning within an organization a social process?
What comes to mind when you think of a “nexus of contracts?” 
How would you relate factors of production and contracts?
What are the three elements of an Alchian output program; how do they relate to contracts; what are the implications for valuing various types of contracts (e.g. a customer relationship)?
Firms have, in general three sorts of choices when they consider acquiring traded goods; what are they?
When are spot markets most efficient?
# Earlier episodes…
What are some of the reasons to pursue a negotiated contract for factor inputs?
What role does factor specificity play in decisions regarding contracting or internal production?
What are “opportunistic” behaviors; what are examples?
Can you distinguish “lock-in” from “hold-up”?
What keeps a relational contract going?
What is a “complete contract;” how many have ever been negotiated?
What sort of evolutionary stages of the law did Ian Macneil discuss as quoted by Williamson?
How does Williamson define the “governance structure”?
How does Lancaster define a product? What are the implications for product design, market research, pricing?
# Earlier Episodes
How did Veblen and Galbraith view advertising?
How would Stigler respond to Veblen and Galbraith?
Why do some people and politicians complain about the proliferation of similar but differentiated products?
How might Lancaster respond to Bernie Sanders, Vermont senator, former presidential candidate, and democratic socialist, who argues that it is inefficient to have so many kinds of deodorant?
What are the characteristics of the lemon principle?
What are some examples of the lemon principle?
# Coase: The Problem of Social Cost
The problem to be examined: 
- Divergence of social and private costs
- Standard (Pigovian) welfare penalized the “offender”
The reciprocal nature of the problem
- To avoid harm to B inflicts harm on A
- Confectioner’s process disturbs a doctor
	- Restrict the confectioner to benefit the doctor or vice versa?
- Restrict a rancher to benefit the farmer or vice versa?
- Alleged Stigler problem of a contaminated stream*
# The Pricing System with Liability for Damage
Assume annual cost of fencing is $9, crop price is $1 per ton
# The Pricing System With No Liability for Damage
Assume initial herd is three steers; rancher has no liability to compensate the farmer
What would the farmer be willing to pay rancher to reduce herd to two steers, to one steer?
How do the farmer’s payments to the rancher compare to the case where the rancher had liability and paid the farmer?
# Taking the Cost of Market Transactions into Account
With transactions costs the assignment of rights matters
Acquisition, i.e. integration, aligns ownership and costs and produces the socially efficient decision
If the affected parties are too numerous for efficient contracting the government may intervene with a variety of policy tools; fees, taxes, zoning, prohibition, etc.
- Note proposed revenue-neutral carbon taxes in Washington State
Reduced administrative costs alone do not assure overall lowest social cost
Government has been known to take non-economic factors into account (Really)
# Pigou’s Treatment in The Economics of Welfare
Coase slams Pigou for incompletely thinking out the problem
“Gotcha” on Pigou’s use of the railway example as being factually incorrect as well as undesirable policy 
The U.K. law in fact relieved the railroad from liability (aside from some minor exceptions) because it had statutory authority to run steam engines
Pigou also seemed to think the railroad should have complete liability for damage to others
The “polluter pays” doctrine may derive from the Hammurabi code and later biblical “eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth” 
# The Railroad Example
Start with the premise the railroad is not liable for damages
What happens when the railroad is liable for damages?
# The Pigovian Fallacy
“The question at issue is not whether it is desirable to run an additional train or a faster train or to install smoke-preventing devices; the question at issue is whether it is desirable to have a system in which the railway has to compensate those who suffer damage from the fires it causes or one in which the railway does not have to compensate them. When an economist is comparing alternative social arrangements, the proper procedure is to compare the total social product yielded by these different arrangements.” (p17)
# Boulston’s Coney Case and Nuisance Law
1597 case between neighboring landowners   
One landowner encouraged the coney population resulting in destruction of the other’s corn   
Ruling held the coney promoter was not liable since he had no ownership interest in wild animals who of their volition traveled to the corn famer’s land
The corn farmer was also free to kill the conies
Professor Williams objected and Coase agreed;  conies should be treated under nuisance law where the damages could be weighed rather than a strict absence of liability 
# Coase’s “New Approach”*
Focus on total effect, not the divergence of private and social costs
Consider what institutional and property rights regimes are most appropriate*
Drop straw man comparisons of laissez faire and ideal world; it promotes looseness of thought
Consider factors of production as rights as opposed to physical entities alone
Recognize that no rights are absolute; a system of unlimited rights is one of no rights
Remember that the cost of exercising a right is always the loss suffered elsewhere in consequence of the exercise
# Other Considerations
How would you compare the 1960 Coase article’s fundamental insights to those of his 1937 article?
What would happen in the railroad example if the railroad was liable and the farmers tried to double their plantings to double their damages? (Consider their ex-ante incentives to plant)
What difficulty do you see in implementing Coase’s suggested approach of looking case-by-case at social costs of different property rights’ policy?
What weight does Coase give to future or unborn people who might gain or lose from a negotiated contract to cause or curtail a damaging activity?
# Next Week, Alas, Our Last New Material
Started the story by asking what is a firm and what functions must it perform
Discussed the boundaries and connections between firms and the market
Emphasized the role information plays in firm, employee and consumer behavior
Introduced the nexus of contracts concept and the governance and contracting frameworks to align the parties
Introduced the evolutionary perspective on markets, firms and products
 Explored the resource and cognitive limits to gathering and using information
 Addressed the bases of customer utility and value and gains from differentiation and segmentation
And next week, we come full circle and discuss the people responsible for creating firms –  entrepreneurs
