# The Critical Importance of Contracts
The Firm is a Nexus of Contracts*
Powerful metaphor
Enables us to connect firm relationships and value
The sum of the contract values equals the value of the firm
Identifies the managerial levers to increase “residual”
How can we use the concept to guide decisions and evaluate the firm?
* Phrasing is from Demsetz although Jensen and Meckling used similar language in an earlier paper
# Oliver Williamson on Transaction-Cost Economics and its Relationship to Organization and Contracting 
Williamson (1979) sought to integrate the insights of
transaction cost economics with a taxonomy of
contractual types and applications:
Opportunism, self-interest seeking with or without guile, is a central concept in the study of transaction costs 
Opportunism is especially important when transaction-specific physical and human investments are involved (the more the potential for lock-in or hold-up, the greater the concern for reneging or exploitation)
The efficient processing of information is closely related to transaction cost
Assessing transactions cost involves comparative institutional analysis
Williamson focuses on intermediate goods and seeks to “dimensionalise” the factors to align governance structures with  transaction characteristics.
# Ian Macneil’s Contract Framework
Ian Macneil distinguishes discrete and relational contracts and the categories of classical contract law, neoclassical contract law and relational contracts.*
Classical contract law attempts to very clearly delineate the nature of the transaction, emphasizes formal over informal, and remedies are narrowly prescribed. Classical contract law sought to achieve a high degree of certainty about outcomes and consequences.
Neoclassical contract law provides for more flexibility in the face of uncertainty. Various means such as arbitration for settling unforeseen and unforeseeable conditions are introduced so that contracts can be executed and people be comfortable with the prospects for equitable settlement.
Relational contracting applies when transactions extend over long periods, involve complex interactions that are not easily solved even by the adaptive tools of the neoclassical contract. There may or not be a formal contract or “original agreement’ and, if present, it may not be given a lot of weight.
Macneil doesn’t note it but contracts are a vehicle for dealing with uncertainty and are shaped in large part by how the parties perceive the uncertainty they face.
Sometimes people execute more than one contract to deal with risk or uncertainty – for example they may enter into a contract for physical services with one party but “hedge” that contract with another involving financial products such as derivatives.  
*See Ian Macneil, 1985, “Relational Contract: “What We Do and Do Not Know About Relational Contract,” Wis. L. Rev. Pp. 483 1985, for a discussion of the legal theory of relational contracts.
# Contracts, Idiosyncrasy, Governance
Macneil’s discussion reveals that contracting is more complex and differentiated than is commonly appreciated
Macneil’s work also confirms that contracts evolve as conditions and requirements of trade among people have evolved
Williamson introduces an awkward term, economics of idiosyncrasy 
- Transactions in which the specific identity of the parties has important cost-bearing consequence. 
- In a purely competitive market, the identity of the parties is immaterial. 
- Idiosyncrasy refers to behavior peculiar to a specific individual or thing.
- This is a class of goods or services in which maximum production economies can be achieved only by tailoring physical and human capital investment to their specifications. 
Williamson defines governance structure as the institutional matrix within which contracts are negotiated and executed  
- Argues that the appropriate structure follows from the degree of asset and transaction specificity of investment.
# Specificity and Opportunistic Behavior
Williamson (1979) notes (recall previous Williamson and Gibbons readings) that the more specific the investment is, the greater the potential for hold-up, lock-in or other opportunistic behavior by one of the parties. 
Parties are reluctant to be trapped in this manner and generally seek contractual protections before making asset or transaction specific investments. 
Since the most important class of idiosyncratic goods are recurring in nature and span significant periods of time, the governance structure (one element of which is the contract) must assure both parties that unforeseen and unforeseeable issues that arise over time will be resolved in an efficient (low cost) and equitable manner.
This might be unnecessary but for the human tendency to opportunism. “If men were angels no government governance structure would be necessary.” – apologies to James Madison
# Production and Transactions Cost
Williamson emphasizes that the sum of production
and transactions costs matters most.
In general if transactions costs are low or negligible, buying is preferred over making because the market can often realize economies by aggregating demand from many buyers
If production cost economies are small and external transactions costs are significant, internal production is often more attractive
# Frequency – Investment Specificity
Recall Williamson’s three dimensions for contractual relations: uncertainty, frequency, and
asset- or transaction- specificity (referred to as idiosyncratic in this context). To these he
adds three degrees of investment-specificity: non-specific, mixed, and
idiosyncratic to produce the taxonomy illustrated below 
# Governance Structures
Williamson considers three types of governance structures: (1) non-transaction
specific, (2) semi specific, and (3) highly specific. These correspond to the
investment categories defined earlier and to the contracting models introduced
from Ian Macneil.
Market Governance: Classical Contracts. The market itself is the main governance structure for non-specific (standardized) transactions, both recurrent and occasional. Legal framework is useful but not the critical factor, legal theory distinguishes between sales and contracts (Lowry).
Trilateral Governance: Neoclassical Contracting. Trilateral governance is applied to occasional transactions of both mixed and idiosyncratic character. Investments in mixed and idiosyncratic transactions are not easily recovered but forging and maintaining bi-lateral arrangements may not be practical for occasional transactions.  Third party arbitration is often employed to leverage an existing source of expertise rather than resort to litigation or create a new structure.
Transaction-specific Governance: Relational Contracting. Specialized governance structures are often devised for recurring mixed and highly idiosyncratic transactions.  The recurrent nature of the transactions supports investment in special structures of two kinds (next slide)
# Transaction-specific Governance: Relational Contracting- Two forms 
Bilateral Governance: Obligational Contracting.*  The nature of highly idiosyncratic transactions, involving very specific investments in physical or human assets, commonly precludes any economies of scale being available to either the buyer or seller
	- Unified Governance: Internal Organization. “Incentives for trading weaken as transactions become progressively more idiosyncratic.” Where there is no factor price, tax or other considerations favoring outside production, highly idiosyncratic transactions frequently move inside to take advantage of lower governance costs.  Thus vertical integration may be expected in cases where the stage of production involves highly idiosyncratic production.
	- *”A contingent contract is a more complex contract that recognizes that the relationship is not instantaneous, but takes place over time during which conditions may change and that the value of exchanged or shared resources is not known in advance but will be known only at a point in time…. These contracts have been called obligational contracts (Williamson.1979).” from Anna Grandori, Organization and Economic Behavior, p.197
# Governance Matrix 
    Williamson captures the relationship between investment types and contract governance structures using the framework we discussed earlier:
# Uncertainty and Governance
Having discussed transactions under certainty at some length, Williamson then declares them uninteresting and suggests that almost any governance structure will meet the needs in a world of certainty. (Recall Knight’s point about uncertainty.) But some changes are needed to accommodate uncertainty:
- The characteristics of standardized transactions in large, well developed markets are not greatly affected by uncertainty so classical contracts are still appropriate.
- Adding uncertainty to transactions contracts makes it even more imperative to devise “machinery” to “work things out.”  
With mixed transactions under uncertainty things might go one of two ways, 
- One is to reduce the degree of uniqueness so that standardized and market rules prevail, or
- Surround the transaction with a more elaborate governance framework.
Uncertainty affecting idiosyncratic investments may act to push them into the unified or internal governance camp, resulting in more vertical integration. 

# Other Applications
Williamson argues that his three-dimensional framework can be applied to other sorts of transactions
- Labor markets. Occasional transactions such as repair or replacement services are conducted on a market basis. 
	- Migrant labor is largely undifferentiated (non-idiosyncratic) transaction. 
	- Mixed transactions in which labor has some idiosyncratic characteristics might be best handled on a group basis, for example, through a union
- Family law. Williamson seems to be reaching here. He suggests only that adjudication not be extended without careful thought.
- Regulation of Natural Monopoly.*
	- Williamson argues that regulation, specifically rate of return regulation, provides parties with security and still allows for adaptation. Examples are utilities and railroads
	- Trucking however does not involve the same degree of transactions-specific investment and the case for regulation is much weaker (as the government eventually realized)
- Capital Markets.  Williamson suggests substituting “ease of verification” for “degree of transaction-specific investment” and then applying the framework. 
*A natural monopoly exists when duplication of investment would clearly be inefficient. For example, an industry might be subject to serious economies of scale in which average cost declines with output. Once an electric transmission system (a very idiosyncratic asset) is built, the costs of additional throughput decline until some limit is reached. To build a duplicate transmission system with each one carrying half the load would involve a rough doubling of investment costs and an increase in variable costs. 
# Williamson’s forms of specificity, cont.
Physical asset specificity.  One or both parties invest in equipment that involves design characteristics peculiar to the transaction and has a lower value, if any, in alternative uses. 
Human asset specificity. Investment in relationship-specific human capital may arise from specific training or a learning-by-doing process. 
- Recall Simon’s point about the importance of practice and the hours necessary to become truly expert. An expert often exemplifies human asset specificity.
- Recall also Nelson and Winter’s point about “routines as genes” and the importance of routine in enabling complex behaviors and addressing the “competency paradox.” 
Relationship between the challenges of contract negotiation and business strategy. 
- Strategists look for ways to capture markets, frustrate rivals, and avoid detection by regulators and anti-trust authorities using the same sort of devices that are of concern in one-on-one contracting.
 
# Implications - General
Non-specific transactions are generally handled by the market
Nonstandard occasional transactions benefit from adjudication
Transaction-specific governance structure when transactions are (1) recurrent, (2) idiosyncratic investment, (3) significant uncertainty
# Specificity of investment on the part of buyer, seller or both 
Supplier protection for transaction specific investment
Buyer protection for investment in the capability to use a particular supplier’s product or system; may want protection from exploitation of  their “locked-in” position.
Oliver Williamson distinguished among a number of types of investment specificity such as:
- Site specificity or “cheek-by-jowl” where the supplier or buyer locates near or adjacent to the other, thus reducing transportation, inventory and communication cost but at a loss of flexibility and increase in costs of accessing alternative suppliers.
- Dedicated asset specificity occurs when one party has to invest in specialized capital equipment or resources well in advance of anticipated deliveries. 
- Supplier, may invest in production capacity or materials with the prospect of a major sale
- Very large ticket items like airliners and yachts typically require large down payments before the producer will commit to acquiring resources. 
- In effect, the buyer is contracting for a place in the production queue and the final good

# Alchian Output Programs and Contracts
Integration of the output program framework and the nexus of contracts concepts permits valuation of management effort and contribution to firm value
First, define costs as the change in shareholder equity. (You can also define revenue net of all costs as a change in shareholder equity.)
An output program is defined by three parameters; the date of delivery, planned volume of output, and the rate of output. 
Much more practical than the Jacob Viner LRAC and LRMC geometry
# Vinerian Long Run Average Costs
# Output Program
The basic idea behind an output program is that
contracting parties have three degrees of freedom. 
 
They can select any combination of date and duration of delivery, volume to be delivered, and the rate of delivery. 
Any two of the parameters determines the third. 
More casually, parties can contract for, say, a volume of 100 cars in an almost infinite number of ways or programs. They might want a rate of 10 cars a day for delivery over 10 days or 50 cars at two distinct dates, etc
The graphical model for a given delivery schedule and for various combinations of volume, V, and rate, x, is shown below.
# Output Program
# Output Program
The output program determines the cost of meeting the contract. By altering the contract, for example extending the schedule, the overall cost might be lowered. Compressing the schedule or raising the rate of output for a given delivery schedule will usually raise the costs. 
Alchian’s concept of an output program is much closer to the way that engineers and plant managers think about production over time and the change in inputs and costs than is the Viner representation. 
More importantly it provides a straightforward way of defining contracts and assessing the determinants of their value. 
Although Alchian’s original article focused on costs, the same parameters can be used to define revenue programs and hence the change in the NPV of the firm’s equity due to an increase in revenues (net of costs).
If we can value contracts as Alchian programs, we can determine the value of management actions and then estimate the change in the residual they create and thus have a notion of what their compensation should be.

Almost single-handedly destroyed GM’s nascent efforts to improve quality

# Customer Relationship Value and Shareholder Value
# Administrative Features of Contracts - Optional
The firm desires to achieve its inputs efficiently. It has a number of contract options for acquiring inputs including.
- Buy the inputs on the open market – a “spot” contract,
- Make a longer term arrangement with a supplier – a negotiated contract, or
- Produce the input itself – vertical integration with internal “contracts”
The choice of contracting method depends upon the nature of the input, the associated transactions costs, the investment necessary to exploit the input contract, and the cost of enforcing contract performance. 
# Spot market transactions and exchanges 
Spot market transactions or exchanges are typically the least costly and overwhelmingly the choice for standardized goods (aka “commodities”). 
Modern exchanges for everything from pork bellies, corn, and crude oil make it simple and efficient to buy standardized goods with no costs of identifying sellers or negotiating contracts. 
For our purposes, futures markets involving options to buy or sell at contract prices are “spot” contracts (the options have an immediate or spot price and are standardized).

# Spot market volatility and uncertainty
#  Protection against bad behavior
The “hold-up problem.” 
Many Ramirez (case of contract failure)
- Manny shirked on the Red Sox in 2008
- Forced a trade to L.A.
- Performed well in L.A. that year
- Failed drug test
- Got another chance
- Failed drug test again
- Out of baseball
- Played minor league ball in 2014
- Hired by Cubs as a part time batting coach in 2015
- Now playing for Kōchi Island Fighting Dogs in Japan. Contract includes free sushi.
Hold-ups often occur when suppliers or buyers make a substantial investment in the capacity to do business with one another.
Holding up your customer or supplier can, like a bad credit rating, influence your future contracts with other parties (reputational effects). 
Supplier abuse can also trigger or reinforce longer-term changes in industry organization that may prove expensive for the abuser
Hold-up problem often occurs when unanticipated changes in the marketplace or within firms causes one of the parties to seek a change in the terms. 
Opportunism is usually a post-contract phenomenon
# Lock-In
Lock-in is similar to hold-up in that it exploits asset specificity but
is often not as disruptive and may not really be a  “bad” behavior
flowing from a bad faith contract. 
Suppliers often seek to “build customer relationships” by “locking-in” or “increasing exit costs” for customers 
Customer is often locked-in after walking through a door marked, “low introductory offer” or “first month free.”  
Similar “low ball” bids are encountered in commercial and industrial procurement. 
Free training and supporting software to increase customer investment in a particular system and hence, exit costs.
Lock-in may also occur as a result of the increasing returns to scale and path dependence nature of some products and services (discussed previously)
# Ecosystems, California and Roach Hotels
Consultant product differentiation leads to new names for old concepts and practices
Above  are new terms for old ideas of lock-in and can be explained by economics of vertical integration
Firms have long tried to extract “rents” from one segment of a value chain by exploiting market power in another (vertical foreclosure). Recall Standard Oil’s pre-1911 position in refining and ability to influence input crude oil prices.
Apple, Google, and Amazon are popular examples of “ecosystems” in which customers and third parties are subject to various levels of lock-in through switching costs. 
# Non Performance
A contract has to be enforceable to be of any value. Classical contracts are enforceable by a court but relational contracts are not. Enforcement is not costless. Enforceability is partly a function of:
The content of the contract. Courts don’t enforce illegal contracts and may be sympathetic to some forms of non-performance ( e.g. commercial impossibility)
The costs of litigation relative to the value of performance, 
The quality of the judicial system. Many contracts contain an agreement to litigate within a particular jurisdiction. Few parties seek litigation in North Korea.
Since litigation is expensive, time consuming, and unpredictable many contracts allow for arbitration over disputes about performance under clearly defined conditions.
To head off disputes, many contracts contain rights of audit and surveillance for the parties. This offsets to some extent the information advantage enjoyed by the seller.
Penalty clauses are useful if the facts are readily determined and both parties consider the penalty reasonable.
Requirements that one or both parties post performance bonds can discourage opportunistic non-performance.
Self-healing and run-flat terms are frequently inserted to maintain a contract’s operation till it can be overhauled by the lawyers or renegotiated.
The terms most likely to be covered by adjustment clauses are those believed beyond the control of either party, and those for which reliable and visible proxy measures are available. 
Any sort of automatic or semi-automatic contract adjustment introduces a form of moral hazard.  
 
# Complete and Incomplete Contracts 
Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom shared the 2016 Nobel in economics for their work on incomplete contracts. http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2016/10/science-deal 
A complete contract is one that anticipates every possible contingency and provides an agreed remedy to every future problem.  Complete contracts are an abstract fiction to simplify analysis.* 
An incomplete contract is one that covers less than 100 per cent of possible situations. All real world contracts are incomplete. The question is where do the parties stop and declare it “complete enough.”
We expect that negotiation costs are proportional to (a) the significance of the issue and (b) the divergence in the positions of the parties and (c) number of parties. 
- At some point, all parties feel that the marginal negotiating costs of resolving remaining potential issues outweighs the expected benefits of tackling them. 
- At this point they may simply ignore the remaining issues, or
- Adopt an adjudication or arbitration mechanism for conflicts not explicitly covered by the contract.
* complete contracts are impossible because people cannot see precisely the future and therefore some uninsurable uncertainty is inevitable
# Complete and incomplete contracts 
Assuming we can order the negotiable terms by value and cost
# Contract Length
Significant contracts are almost always expensive and time consuming to negotiate and represent an investment or asset to both firms. Each would like to avoid both unnecessary future contracting costs maintain flexibility in light of the uncertainty 
One or both parties may have to make the sort of specific investments discussed above and wants to ensure a contract length sufficient to recover its investment. 
In the graphic (next slide) the parties reached agreement on terms, including duration, at the intersection of the lower marginal benefit curve and the upper marginal cost curve, which is shown as d0.  
 If the marginal benefit curve shifts up for some reason, say, due to more contract specific investment, and the marginal cost of negotiation declines, say, due to better negotiating technology, the new contract duration may increase to d1.  The final resting place for d depends on the direction and magnitude of the marginal cost and marginal benefit curves and the resulting intersection.
# Contract Length
# Contracting Environment
Some contracting environments are more costly
and difficult to work within than others. 
The more complex and uncertain the environment, the shorter the typical contract length. 
The less complex the environment, say, due to standardization of products, settled precedents, etc. the longer the contracts. 
One of the underappreciated economic benefits of decent legal system
# Financial Asset and Option Approach
The expected future level of any contract variable may be thought of as a series of distributions around the expected value. We know the current wage rate and the level of productivity of workers and have some notion of the trends in productivity and demand for labor. In general we are more confident (anticipate a tighter distribution around the expected value) of near term projections than of estimates of longer-term conditions. 
When the buyer agrees to a contract schedule of input prices and quantities, she is basing her decision on the prices and quantities she expects to receive from her customers. Conversely the supplier is agreeing to deliver the inputs (his outputs) at prices and quantities that he believes will provide a profit based on expectations of his future input and production costs. 
When the future conditions are too uncertain or murky to commit to a longer contract but there is a preference for continuing the contract if things look favorable, firms (and individuals) may include renewal options in the original contract. 
# Financial Asset and Option Approach, cont
The most prominent of these “option” contracts are those for professional athletes that give the club the right but not the obligation to renew the contract or the player the right to “opt-out” after a period of time. (Recall discussion of Manny above.)
The compensation in the contract will reflect the value of the option on the player’s services beyond the guaranteed portion. 
Assignable or transferable contracts may be sold, usually by the purchasing party, to someone who wasn’t a party to the original contract. This reduces the quantity risks of the buyer and may be desirable to a supplier by reducing his re-contracting costs. 
Econometricians describe this situation with the delightful word heteroscedasticity which means, roughly, that the variance about the mean varies and tends to increase at farther out points in time. 
# Financial Asset and Option Approach
Heteroscedasticity
# Contracting and Negotiating Strategies
Both parties believe they may gain from the contract or they would not enter
into negotiations. But, there is no guarantee that either will realize the full
benefit possible. Negotiating strategies are often looked at today in game
theoretic terms. 
One common negotiating strategy is to run the clock out with patience and obstreperous behavior. This increases transactions costs and may reduce the expected benefit to the other party.
This is essentially an attempt to increase the other party’s cost of negotiating and forcing him to settle for lesser level of contract completeness.  
Of course, being a jerk only works if what you possess is worth the trouble to the other party. [Think about the late Kim Jong-il and his recurrent negotiations with various countries over his nuclear program. His son Kim Jong-un may may be applying this theory to negotiations with Donald Trump.] 
Most modern negotiating texts are full of advice for “win-win” strategies. The Prisoner’s Dilemma is invoked ad nauseam.  
Most current economic treatments of negotiation are based largely on game theory.
