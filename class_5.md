# The Economics of Business
# Quiz 4 (Klepper)
1. What is the economic issue investigated by Klepper in his 2002 article, “Firm Survival and the Evolution of Oligopoly”?
- Why do oligopolies form in some industries and not others?
- What factors explain the frequently observed pattern of industry evolution among firms characterized initially by substantial entry followed by shakeout and the emergence of oligopoly?
- How does prior experience condition success in technologically progressive industries?
- All of the above
 
2. What is the major factor determining firm survival in the Klepper model?
- Prior experience of the firm or its founders
- R&D productivity 
- Resistance to random cost shocks
- None of the above
 
3. Over time, the average hazard of experienced and inexperienced firms in the early entry cohorts tend to converge. This can be explained by:
- Early entrant cohorts include both type 1 and type 2 firms. All experienced firms are type 1 but inexperienced firms are a mixture of type 1 and type 2.
- As early entry firms age, type 2 firms exit disproportionately, lowering the average hazard of inexperienced firms in the cohort toward that of the experienced firms
- Both of the above factors explain the convergence

4, Earlier entrants tend to grow larger and survive longer than do otherwise identical later entrants at every age. At every age the earlier entrants will be larger than similar but later entry firms. This can be explained by:
- The earlier entrants enjoy larger industry margins (p-c) and therefore conduct more R&D and grow larger.  Since R&D spending is conditioned by size at every age, the earlier entry firms will conduct more R&D (which reduces costs) and have higher profit margins.
- The larger size and higher margins of the earlier entrant at every age makes it less likely they will exit due to price shocks (random exit).
- Both of the above. 
 
5. The theory predicts that at older ages the survival curves should be ordered by time of entry, earliest to latest. Only the latest tire cohort (1930-1980) violated this prediction. What sort of event would be suspected as the cause of this anomaly?
- The last cohort entered after a particularly hazardous period that affected greatly the earlier cohorts, increasing significantly their hazard 
- The later cohort was able to employ a superior technology not readily applied by the earlier groups
- Both of the above 
6. The theory predicts that the greater the percentage of early entrants with prior experience, the earlier will be the divergence with respect to time of entry. This pattern is consistent with the experience of television and penicillin.
- True
- False 
# Quiz 4, continued
7. The theory (e.g. hypothesis 2) predicts that early entry lowers the hazard among experienced firms at all ages, whereas it may lower the hazard among inexperienced firms only at older ages. What factors might explain this?
- Early inexperienced entrants will be made up of both type 1 and type 2 firms
- At younger ages the type 2 inexperienced firms will exit at a disproportionately higher rates causing the average hazard of the inexperienced firms to converge toward the experienced firms
- Both of the factors help explain the prediction
 
8. The WWII project sponsored by the U.K. and U.S. governments to identify and implement technologies and processes to produce large amounts of penicillin greatly influenced the shape of the subsequent industry. This was the result of:
- A large proportion of the early entrants were members of the project
- Members of the project became experienced, Type 1 firms through their experience
- Both of the above 
# Quiz 4, continued
9. During the shake-out period government anti-trust authorities, usually spurred by failing competitors, often consider anti-trust actions. Which factors might caution against aggressive anti-trust action driven by industry concentration?
- The analysis shows that the emergence of oligopoly often comes about “naturally” as a consequence of the superior cost reduction capability acquired by early entrants through larger R&D investments
- The advantage of large firms to appropriate the gains from R&D encourages them to invest more in R&D
- Breaking up or otherwise restricting the small group of survivors – the oligopolists- may reduce economic efficiency and lead to higher prices
- All of the above
 10. The rapid increase in firm numbers, the high peak number of competing firms and the often precipitous decline in firm numbers (shakeout) suggest:
- The market generates variety and then adopts those most fit by awarding them with survival and profits
- The government could avoid a great deal of wasted effort by identifying the “best” approach early rather than letting the market work it out
- Both of the above

# Recap, continued
A common reason given for divestures is:
“a firm's "break-up" value is sometimes believed to be greater than the market value of the firm as a whole. In other words, the sum of a firm's individual asset liquidation values exceeds the market value of the firm's combined assets. This encourages firms to sell off what would be worth more when liquidated than when retained.” (from Wikipedia but expressed in many places.)
- How would you relate this reason to Knight’s notion of entrepreneurial capacity?
- Henry Manne and Robert Lucas pointed out that in a perfectly efficient market for corporate control the best entrepreneurs would wind up with the most assets under their control, successively less effective entrepreneurs would wind up with proportionally fewer assets under their control. How does this point relate to the current spate of divestitures?
- How would you interpret the pattern of GE sell-offs?
# Recap, continued
“a firm may divest (sell) businesses that are not part of its core operations so that it can focus on what it does best.” (also from Wikipedia)
- How would you express this reason in terms of entrepreneurial capacity?
- Is this consistent with Coase’s notion of the limits to scale and scope associated with multi-product lines using von Thunen’s concentric rings as an analogy to organizing costs for different product transactions from a central point (p. 402)?
# Oliver Williamson’s Transactions Cost Approach to Economic Organization
Three areas of interest:
Overall structure of enterprise, how operating parts relate to one another
Defining efficient boundaries of the firm
Organizing internal work groups (teams?) with respect to worker attributes and governance options
# Williamson’s View of the Firm in a Nutshell
“I submit that the modern corporation is mainly to be understood as the product of a series of organizational innovations that have had the purpose and effect of economizing on transaction costs.”1
1 Oliver E. Williamson, “The Modern Corporation: Origins, Evolution, Attributes,” Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Dec., 1981), pp. 1537-1568 
# Typical Organizational Designs
Keep in mind various popular organizational models when reviewing Williamson’s TCE
- Functional
- Divisional
- Matrix
- Team
- Network
# Antecedents to Williamson TCE
John R. Commons (1862-1945) early Institutional
    Economist, contemporary of Thorstein Veblen, 
- evolutionary economic perspective, contributed to progressive movement, very unfortunate racial views 
New Institutional Economics exemplified by Douglass North, Elinor Ostrom, and others that examines how people work in aggregate to create and operate institutions to deal with social and economic issues
Ronald Coase founder of TCE later expanded by Williamson
Others cited including Hayek, Arrow, Barnard, Simon, March, Chandler, etc. who shared some common notions of organization or influenced Williamson’s approach
Williamson’s major contribution was to apply economic reasoning to the structure of the firm and other organizations.
# Rudiments
Transaction occurs when a good or service is transferred across a technologically separable interface. One stage of activity terminates and another begins.
The economic counterpart of friction is transaction cost
# Dimensionalizing (ugly, jargony word) 
Transaction cost is the opportunity cost of resources consumed by the transaction
Transaction cost economics looks at the comparative costs of transactions under alternative governance structures
Three dimensions:
- Uncertainty (used here in the common sense rather than as distinguished from risk by Knight)
- Frequency
- Asset specificity
# Efficient Boundaries
- Company conducts those transactions where the net advantage
- in production cost and governance costs favors internal
- production
# Degree of Asset Specificity and Consequences for Production Costs
Asset specificity is desired not for itself but because of increased performance or design 
- Asset specificity may not decrease and may increase costs because standard or general assets could achieve greater scale economies
- Such valued demand consequences are often realized only at greater production expense. Standardized items are often cheaper because of scale economies.
- The optimal level of asset specificity involves considering both demand and production cost consequences
- Governance costs also vary with asset specificity and must be considered
In general, if assets or goods are non-specific, markets enjoy advantages in their provision
# Big Muskie DraglineWith a Marching Band in the Shovel
# Finding the Internal-External Boundary
The progression from market to internal
provision can be described algebraically:
Let ∆C = f(A) the production cost difference between internal and market 
Let ∆G = g(A) the governance cost difference between internal and market
- If  ∆C +  ∆G > 0 market transactions are advantaged
- If  ∆C +  ∆G = 0 the firm is indifferent between market and internal provision
- If  ∆C +  ∆G < 0 internal production is advantaged over market
# Internal  - External Boundary (graphic)
Graphical representation of preceding algebra:
# Asset Specificity and Vertical Integration
Williamson discusses two examples:
General Motors/Fisher Body
- Initial contract was imperfect (all are, the specifics vary)
- GM desired closer integration of effort by Fisher
- Fisher was reluctant, feared hold-up
- GM finally bought Fisher and achieved integration (unified governance)
19th century forward integration by manufacturers into wholesale and retail operations
# GM-Fisher Revisited Redux
Williamson portrays GM-Fisher as a merger to install a unified governance structure and reduce transactions costs. This view has been questioned.
Klein, Crawford, Alchian (KCA) also used the GM-Fisher case but used it to illustrate opportunistic hold-up by Fisher exploiting the contract terms*
Coase objected to the KCA analysis and argued that they did not consider adequately the contracting option
Klein, responded in 1988 by restating and adding support for the hold-up interpretation. He asked for comment from Williamson and Demsetz and suggests that they agreed with his interpretation.
Coase and others still challenged the KCA interpretation of the GM-Fisher case
Klein responded yet again in 2000, with a much longer article, and has seemingly settled the dispute with Coase (who is deceased).
New interpretations still appear occasionally. But we are pretty sure that Fisher’s behavior annoyed GM and GM solved the problem by buying Fisher.

# Human Asset Specificity and Governance
Governance issues arise primarily when skills are specific to the firm. E.g. lawyers, physicians, engineers are skilled but unless skill is deepened to suit specific employer, they are largely interchangeable
Skill deepening through experience may not cause a governance issue. Typists improve through experience but may be valued equally by current and prospective employers. But a filing clerk may have very important firm-specific skills and value.
Human assets can be distinguished by degree of firm-specificity and the ease by which their contribution or productivity can be measured.
# Types of Human Asset Governance
Spot Market: non-specific and easy to measure. Neither employee nor firm has strong interest in maintaining the relationship.
Primitive team: non-specific but hard to measure.* Very modest investment in relationship – largely monitoring
Obligational market: firm-specific learning but easy to measure. Investment in and access to idiosyncratic skills is important to firm and employee and retention efforts will be significant.
Relational team: firm specific and difficult to measure. Both firm and employee have strong interest in maintaining the relationship. (Utopian societies example?)
* Williamson gives incomplete and, I believe, misleading interpretation of Alchian and Demsetz’ “team”
# Human Asset Specificity and Governance:One Size Does Not Fit All
Williamson goes beyond the metering considerations introduced by
Alchian and Demsetz with the notion of differential human asset
specificity to create a rough taxonomy of governance forms 
# Application of Human Asset Specificity to Union Organization
Incentive to organize production workers within collective governance structure increases with human asset specificity
The degree to which an internal structure is elaborated (e.g. ladders, scales, procedures, etc) varies directly with human asset specificity (The aim, not always realized, is that progressing up the ladder makes one more firm-specific and valuable. 
Too often seniority gets to be the dominant factor and the system may discourage acquiring outside knowledge.)
TCE predicts production worker organization earlier in sectors with job specific skills (e.g. railroads) and that the degree of internal elaboration will be highest in those sorts of industries
Williamson’s discussion of alternative approaches is interesting but dated in an era when industrial unions are declining and public unions ascending.
# Transfer Pricing (Optional)
We can think of a firm as a sort of alternative market (recall ending of Alchian and Demsetz)
Although the firm may suppress the price system, it generally employs an ersatz internal price system often called transfer pricing 
The internal units of the firm trade among each other using:
- Budgets – central planning
- Transfer pricing 
- Bidding – e.g. plants may bid for new work 
Transfer pricing usually involves some sort of cost allocation or fixed cost allocation to output
Many transfer prices are based largely on “average, fully loaded costs.”
Make-or-buy decisions are complicated by difficulty comparing the “real” internal costs and external prices
Businesses in the ’80’s became very interested in outsourcing as a cost management tool and examined their internal costs
There was a tendency to compare the internal transfer cost to the external acquisition cost which can be very misleading
Hirshleifer set out a framework for examining internal and external prices
# Hirshleifer, Transfer Pricing
Internal pricing, two intermediate goods, one finished good,
sold into competitive market:
# One Final Product Sold in Competitive Market, Two Intermediate Goods, Autonomously Derived Joint Profit 
Managers of B derive a net marginal revenue curve, present it to A who then maximizes “profit” at MCA = (P-MCB) = MRA
Result is identical to the centrally determined transfer prices in preceding example
# Imperfectly competitive output market 
Case a: Perfectly competitive input (intermediate) goods
markets 
# Hirshleifer, continued
Demand dependence and technological dependence among the divisions:
- Demand dependence reflects the degree of connectedness between the two markets.  Depending upon the relative market power enjoyed by the firm in each of the markets, it may, under some circumstances, pay to subsidize the final good selling division (distribution or B). 
- Technological dependence, when output by one is technologically dependent on the other or there are production complementarities across the outputs, it is extremely difficult to work with on a generalized basis.
# Hirshleifer, continued
Relationship to vertical integration, outsourcing:
 Hirshleifer recognized that his analysis would be attractive to those considering divesting or acquiring elements of a vertical production process 
Warned that such decisions should be based on a more comprehensive firm-wide analysis. What additional costs might be included in the wider analysis? (Hint: What costs did Coase [1937]emphasize?)
