# The Economics of Business
# Class 11 (Lancaster) Quiz 
What economic problem is Lancaster addressing and proposing a solution for?
- The excessive focus on ordinal utility as the basis for choice or preference.
- The explanatory power of the traditional indifference curve, budget line model of consumer behavior.
- The inability of traditional consumer behavior theory to provide insights into the nature of complementarity, substitutability, new goods assessment and to make little or no use of a great deal of information.
- None of the above.
How does Lancaster propose to solve this problem?
- By assuming that goods per se do not yield utility
- Arguing that it is the characteristics of goods which give rise to utility
- Pointing out that consumption is a process by which the consumer constructs a collection of characteristics that yield utility
- All of the above
Even a single good may have more than one characteristic (e.g. taste, texture, and calories). Therefore:
- Consumption will involve joint outputs
- Some characteristics may be shared with seemingly unrelated goods
- Both of the above.
Which of these factors describes Lancaster’s proposed model of consumer behavior?
- A good, per se, does not give utility. It comprises characteristics which provide utility.
- A good will often contain more than one characteristic and those may be shared with other goods
- Goods in combination may possess characteristics different from the separate goods
- All of the above
- None of the above
# Class 10 Quiz, continued
6. Lancaster’s model of consumer behavior involves:
- Goods or collections of goods constitute a consumption activity
- Each consumption activity produces a fixed linear vector of characteristics 
- Individuals possess ordinal utility functions with respect to characteristics and seek to maximize utility 
- All of the above
 
7. In a complex economy, the number of goods frequently exceeds the number of characteristics.  In this case the analysis of consumer behavior comprises:
- For every characteristics vector there is more than one goods vector
- For every point in characteristics space (where the axes are measured in terms of the characteristics) the consumer faces a choice among goods vectors 
- The consumer will choose (based on the goods’ prices) the most efficient combination of goods that provides the desired collection of characteristics
- All of the above 
8. To identify the most efficient collection of characteristics we can apply a form of activity analysis with which features?
- The relevant length of a goods vector is the point where the consumer’s budget is devoted entirely to that good – the maximum quantity possible
- The trade-off between two characteristics vectors can be portrayed by a line connecting the points of maximum achievable quantities for those two goods on the two vectors
- The efficient frontier for the customer choosing among many characteristic vectors is determined by the highest attainable quantity given the budget constraint
- The customer will choose the collection of characteristics where her indifference curve is tangent to the efficient frontier.
- All of the above
# Class 11 Quiz
9. Goods from different intrinsic commodity groups can be regarded as intrinsically unrelated while goods from the same intrinsic commodity group can be regarded as intrinsically related.
- True
- False
 
10. If, within an intrinsically related commodity group there are two activities each with a unique or one-to-one relationship to a different good, and the characteristics derived from the two goods differ only by some constant value the two goods in question can be regarded as:
- Intrinsic perfect substitutes
- Close substitutes
- Neither, the goods are complements 
# In Previous Episodes of E1600 (may help prepare for final)
How did Frank Knight distinguish risk and uncertainty?
Is profit the reward for bearing risk (in Knightian terms)?
What are the classical concepts of rationality?
- Maxi-Min rule
- Probabilistic rule
- Certainty rule
If people have to make decisions under uncertainty, how does Simon suggest they proceed (i.e. what are the essential simplifications)? E.g. the parameters of the problem one can manage
- Simple pay-off functions
- Information gathering
- Partial ordering of pay-offs
How does Nelson and Winter’s notion of the competency puzzle relate to Simon’s bounded rationality?
If you are familiar with Bayesian statistical analysis, how would you connect it with the sort of judgment defined by Knight and the acquisition of expertise described by Simon?

The purported economies of vertical integration include which of the following?
- Seizing of intermediate profits
- The improvement of technical processes through continuous operation
- Security of supply and access to markets
How extensive did Jewkes think the benefits of vertical integration were under competition and stability?
Under what sort of market structures does vertical integration seem most attractive?
Commercial “self sufficiency” (through integration) is often offset by what technical consideration?
# Thorstein Veblen on Sports
Thorstein Veblen said, “The addiction to sports, therefore, in a peculiar degree marks an arrested development in man’s moral nature.” 
Is this consistent with neoclassical utility theory? 
Why would anyone listen to this man?
# Veblen on Advertising…
Veblen also said,
   “Advertising is competitive; the greater part of it aims to divert purchases, etc., from one channel to another channel of the same general class. And to the extent to which the efforts of advertising in all its branches are spent on this competitive disturbance of trade, they are, on the whole, of slight if any immediate service to the community.“Such advertising, however, is indispensable to most branches of modern industry; but the necessity of most of the advertising is not due to its serving the needs of the community nor to any aggregate advantage accruing to the concerts which advertise, but to the fact that a business concern which falls short in advertising fails to get its share of trade.Each [business] concern must advertise, chiefly because the others do.”
How might Lancaster respond? 
How might Stigler respond?
# Economics is often misunderstood (what’s wrong with this statement?)
	“In a broader sense, the ratings agencies’ problem was in being unable or uninterested in appreciating the distinction between risk and uncertainty.
	Risk, as first articulated by the economist Frank H. Knight in 1921, is something that you can put a price on. Say that you’ll win a poker hand unless your opponent draws for an inside straight: the chances of that happening are exactly  1 chance in 11. This is risk. It is not pleasant when you take a “bad bet” in poker, but at least you know the odds of it and can account for it ahead of time. In the long run, you’ll make a profit from your opponents making desperate draws on insufficient odds.
	Uncertainty, on the other hand, is risk that is hard to measure. You might have some vague awareness of the demons lurking out there. You might even be acutely concerned about them. But you have no real idea how many of them there are or when they might strike. Your back-of-the-envelope estimate might be off by a factor of 100 or by a factor of 1000; there is no way to know. This is uncertainty. Risk greases the wheels of a free-market economy; uncertainty grinds them to a halt.”
Nate Silver, The Signal and the Noise, 2012, Penguin Press, NYC, 545 p. 
# Information Costs Infect Everything
Recall Coase (1937) argument that information costs were a major reason for creating firms
Alchian and Demsetz emphasis on internal metering and monitoring costs
Simon described a behavioral model of seeking information 
Gibbons noted the difficulty of measuring actual output and the issues with proxies
# George Stigler and The Economics of Information
Information “occupies a slum dwelling in the town of economics” (thanks in large part to him it no longer does)
Price dispersion is a manifestation and measure “of ignorance in the market”
Some dispersion is the result of heterogeneity (recall Lancaster multi-attribute goods) but some is ignorance
Transactions costs e.g. re-labeling all goods, comparing all rivals, seeking all prices, etc. inhibit price uniformity
At any time a distribution or dispersion (probably skewed right) prevails for prices 
# Sampling and Searching
Stigler’s illustrative marketplace is similar to a jar with equal numbers of black ($3) and white ($2) marbles. 
The probability of drawing a white or a black ball is .5. therefore the expected first draw value is: 
E(P) = .5($3) + .5($2) =$2.50 
First draw is for maximum or minimum value; continue the experiment, our expected minimum price observation converges on the real minimum of $2.00. 
Chances of drawing a $3 or a $2 ball on the second try is still .5 but, the chances of drawing the same value ball as from the first draw is only  .5 * .5 or .25
Chance of drawing a white ($2) ball after three draws is same as one minus chance of drawing 3 black balls:
 1- (.5*.5*.5) = 1 - .125 = .875
Now the expected minimum price is .875*($2) + .125*($3) = $2.125
# Sampling and Searching continued
# Expected Incremental Minimum Price
# Introduce the Search Costs to Find Optimal
As always we equate the marginal or incremental return to the marginal cost.
Assume a $.10 constant search cost:
# Search and Recurrent Purchase
Stigler ignores the second term which he believes is usually minor
That may not be the case, especially for recurrent purchases or contracts.
The demand curve below shows increase in one consumer’s purchase
program as she discovers the lower prices available. (q = 30 – 2p).
# Uniform Distribution of Prices
In a uniform distribution (sometimes called a rectangular distribution) the frequency or probability of every value is the same. Flipping a coin, tossing a die…
Normalized by dividing all values by the maximum value, resulting in distribution from 0 to 1. 
Normalized form of the uniform distribution properties:
- The distribution of minimum prices with n searches is: 
- The average minimum price is:
 
- Finally, the variance of the average minimum price is:                                        
                                                   
# Search and Sampling 
As you increase number of searches, your chances of
finding  a representative from the lower end increase:
# Expected Savings for Incremental Searches
Ceteris paribus: expected net savings of an incremental search will be:
- Greater the higher the expenditure on the commodity. You will search longer and harder for a car than for a popsicle. 
- The larger the fraction of the buyer’s expenditures represented by the commodity, the greater the potential savings and hence the greater the amount of search.
- Greater the dispersion of the prices. If prices are all over the place, you will sense that looking further may well pay off.  
- The greater the geographical extent of the market the larger will be the cost of search and therefore less will be undertaken.
- Smaller the higher the cost per search. If sellers are widely separated or it is difficult to compare quality or other factors, you will settle sooner. Conversely, if search is facilitated by the Internet, Consumer Reports, or other information sources, you can search more extensively.
# Expected Savings Per Incremental Search, continued
The higher the positive correlation of prices over successive searches, the less investment in search in subsequent periods. If buyer finds that repeated searches reveal the same results, he is likely to reduce or eliminate searches for that product.
- Gives rise to reputational advantages, a form of brand equity, 
- Stigler suggests that goodwill can be defined as the propensity to purchase without significant re-searching
- Tendency to “lock-in” perceptions formed by multiple searches explains why Wal-Mart seeks to be identified as the low cost supplier and maintain an everyday low price policy. “Sales” are a form of search-provoking tactic.  
- Explains why bad reputations are so hard to shed – people have to go back to searching and must have a strong incentive to do so. Hyundai, for example, had to introduce exceptional warranties to offset the bad taste left by their earlier low quality.
- Explains why tourists, without accumulated knowledge of prices, pay more than locals 
The need for search never goes completely away; there will always be some price dispersion: 
- Information becomes obsolete with shifting supply and demand patterns. 
- Retailers change strategies; some are slower to re-price than others.
- Local conditions may diverge from regional or national norms.
# Advertising
Stigler, like Lancaster, takes a kinder view of advertising than did (do) many economists such as Veblen and Galbraith. 
Advertising provides information for buyers. If search is costly and advertising reduces search costs, it adds to buyer utility
Advertising for buyers reduces the search costs of buyers. (Imagine that all advertising was banned tomorrow.)
In the absence of advertising (especially price advertising), buyers would have to spend more to find a satisfactory price and would therefore succeed less often with the result that less would be purchased. 
People object to some forms of advertising, especially that which emphasizes intangible qualities, but buyers are able to evaluate messages and when wrong, can alter their behavior.
# Advertising, continued
Consider advertising a way to inform N customers where c=g(a) is the proportion reached, a is the volume of advertising. 
Generally encounter diminishing returns at some point
What about viral advertising?
How does viral advertising differ 
from word-of-mouth?
# Advertising, continued
Let N be total of potential customers 
Let b equal the number of new customers who are born or die each period then the path of informed customers will be: 
- cN in the first period 
- In the second period cN(1-b) customers will still be informed and cbN new potential customers will be reached while c[(1-b)N – cN(1-b)] of the old potential customers not reached the first time will now be informed. 
- Total is now: cN[1+ (1-b)(1-c)]
-  
# Advertising
You can generalize this sequence into an infinite series over k periods and then find the limit as k gets large as:
cN/1-(1-c)(1-b) =N
 
The proportion of buyers informed,  ,  thus depends on c and b. As c and/or b are large relative to 1 (as proportions both must be less than or equal to 1) then  will become larger
If there are r sellers advertising, then  is the probability of any one of them reaching any particular customer and the number of sellers therefore known to an average buyer is between 0 and r with a mean of r and variance r(1-). 
The more advertising and by more sellers, the larger the number of sellers known to each buyer and the lower the variance in knowledge among buyers.
 
Sellers will invest in marketing so long as the incremental revenue from more contacts, which requires an estimate of propensity to buy for each new contact, is greater than or equal to the cost of reaching an incremental prospect. 
# Brokers as Information Appliances
Advertising is less effective when there are relatively few buyers as a percentage of the medium’s circulation or viewership. Specialized dealers (brokers) arise in this situation. 
- E.g. My friend Larry Rayman, managing director of GTI Power, is a specialist in quickly finding and delivering aircraft components
- He knows a vast number of operators and suppliers. 
- Operators, distributors, and manufacturers contact him about needs and availability of parts. 
Larry is essentially an information appliance. 
- Why do you think Larry has not been digitally displaced?
# Advertising, continued
Advertising mediums have to attract potential buyers in order to offer value to sellers. 
The creation of newspaper or television program can be viewed as a device to assemble potential buyers for the advertisers. 
Hence concern about ratings and demographics. 
In conclusion, Stigler notes that ignorance is like sub-zero weather (recall that he taught at the University of Chicago). We can spend to reduce its effects and even achieve a degree of comfort but it is uneconomic to eliminate all of its effects. So too we can neither eliminate nor ignore the cold winds of ignorance.
 
# Thoughts for Discussion
Stigler, like Simon, does not assume hyper-rationality (e.g. omniscience on market prices) on the parts of buyers and sellers. Is his model of search a form of bounded rationality?
Stigler describes search costs and investment in them as part of the product transaction. Does this anticipate Williamson’s notion of transactions costs as an element to be considered in choosing among governance or contracting relationships?
Does Stigler’s treatment of search costs comport with Coase’s notion of costs to use the market?
# Dilemma of Buying
Verifying quality is a long time problem; 
- Archimedes (~287-212BC) and the gold content of crown for Hero II of Syracuse
	- Famous “eureka” moment in tub and streaking (literally) through town
	- Method described in historical lore probably wouldn’t work (see for example: www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/weights.html    
	- Counterfeiting was a capital offense in ancient Rome
Ancients relied heavily on severe after-the-fact penalties
- Hammurabi code (~1772 BC) on building defects: “If a builder has built a house for a man, and has not made his work sound, and the house he built has fallen, and caused the death of its owner, that builder shall be put to death.”
Modern societies implement many before-the-fact licenses, certifying agencies, building codes, etc. 
- About 30 percent of American occupations require a license
- States such as Arizona are finally realizing that this is a form of crony capitalism that provides rents to incumbents and discourages competition
Caveat Emptor good advice but unclear legal role
“Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth” – not entirely rational
Implied warranties are a relatively recent legal innovation
Some believe the “lemon principle” is less relevant today due to Internet and expanded access to information but those same forces appear to make it easier to spread disinformation
# George Akerlof: The Market for Lemons
Won 2001 Economic Nobel Prize largely for 1970 QJE article “The Market for "Lemons": Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism”
Not accepted immediately nor adopted widely for several years: “ a struggling attempt…”
Now a mainstay of understanding how asymmetric information may distort or damage markets
A structure for analysis of “economic costs of dishonesty”
Another case of divergence of social and private costs
Concept is useful in exploring opportunities for information-producing or sharing products
Married to Janet Yellen, former Chair of the FRB and current U.S. Treasury Secretary who is probably the most powerful economist (and arguably woman) on earth  
# Akerlof’s Used Car Market
Buyer has a notion that he has q probability of buying a good quality car; and (1-q) probability of a “lemon.”
Buyer cannot discern individual quality but has an idea of what q is
Buyer must assume all used cars are average quality and is only willing to pay that price
As a consequence, sellers of above-average vehicles tend to withhold them, sellers of below average vehicles tend to offer them 
A destructive dynamic ensues in which q declines, expected average quality drops, even fewer good quality vehicles are offered….
Eventually the lemons may drive out the cream puffs and even the average quality cars, leading ultimately to collapse
# Trader Types 1 and 2
Akerlof defined the demand, Qd, for used cars as function of price, p, and average quality of cars, μ
							- Qd = D(p, μ)
Average quality, μ, is a function of price, p
							-  μ = μ(p)
Supply, S, is also a function of price, p
							- S = S(p)
Equilibrium: supply equals demand
							- D(p, μ) = S(p)
Begin by defining traders’ utility functions

# Supply Curve for the Symmetric Information Case
Supply, S, in the symmetrical information case is a 2
part function depending upon whether p>1 or p<1

# Examples of Lemon Principle
Medical Insurance
- Geezers and sick people find it difficult to buy medical insurance
- Government mandate to sell to pre-existing conditions creates a moral hazard (geezer has the asymmetric information advantage)
- Actuarial remedy is to require all to buy (a mandate)* 
	- Many people hate mandates and ignore them or pay the fine
	- Enforcement is expensive and imperfect
- Ratio of healthy to unhealthy declines, unit costs increase
- No longer “insurance” as usually defined
- *The US Supreme Court ruled that the ACA was constitutional because the mandate was, 
- in effect, a tax. The Congress then removed the mandate and several state AGs have
- sued to have the remaining parts of the ACA ruled unconstitutional. 
# Examples of Lemon Principle, continued
Minority qualifications and hiring
- Minority status may, unfortunately, be a fairly accurate indicator of educational quality in U.S. 1
- School policies of social promotion and grade inflation erode value of high school degree
- Employers cannot easily distinguish among top, middle and bottom of high school graduates
- Special efforts to improve quality of minority education and reestablish standards may raise the perceived average quality

Well intentioned people may think less information is better
New Jersey and NYC both passed BTB laws intended to help minority applicants
Agan and Starr, sent 15,000 electronic applications aimed at lower level entry jobs. Applications were sent before and after the laws took effect
Major finding: BTB policies encourage statistical discrimination on the basis of race. 
 Overall, white applicants received 23% more callbacks than similar black applicants (38% more in New Jersey; 6% more in New York City. (The white advantage is much larger in whiter neighborhoods).  
Employers that ask about criminal records are 62% more likely to call back an applicant if he has no record (45% in New Jersey; 78% in New York City)—an effect that BTB compliance eliminates. 
The racial gap in callbacks grew dramatically at the BTB-affected companies after the policy went into effect. Before BTB, white applicants to BTB-affected employers received about 7% more callbacks than similar black applicants, but BTB increased this gap to 45%. 
Oddly, Agan and Starr do not mention Akerlof or the lemon principle

# Insider Trading and Asymmetric Information
A lot of people define asymmetric information in securities trading as anything not known generally to the public at large
In fact, the exercise of asymmetric information most often adds to the public’s information about the value of a security
It is illegal to betray a fiduciary trust; not to enjoy an asymmetric information advantage
“Although the government might like the law to be different,” Judge Barrington Parker wrote for the Second Circuit, “nothing in the law requires a symmetry of information in the nation’s securities markets. . . . Insider trading liability is based on breaches of fiduciary duty, not on informational asymmetries. This is a critical limitation on insider trading liability that protects a corporation’s interests in confidentiality while promoting efficiency in the nation’s securities markets.”*
*Quote from recent 2d Circuit Court Opinion overturning, with prejudice, a conviction gained by federal prosecutor, Preet Bharara, see L. Gordon Crovitz, April 12, 2015, Information Is Not a Crime,” WSJ , chttp://www.wsj.com/articles/information-is-not-a-crime-1428876543?mod=hp_opinion   
# Examples of Lemon Principle, continued
Dishonesty
- Some merchants may exploit asymmetric information to lie about the quality of their goods
- Even if some other merchants are honest, the buyers may not be able to distinguish the honest from the liars and so shun the market
- In this case, the loss is not only lost sales by the crooks but loss of businesses by the honest merchants
- In some cases, the government or an industry group may need to vouch for quality, particularly in underdeveloped countries

# Credit Markets in Undeveloped Countries
Commercial banks in undeveloped countries may not be able to distinguish credit worthiness
- Local moneylenders exploit the banks’ ignorance and charge very high rates
- Similar things happen in poorer neighborhoods in the U.S. (paycheck loans from Legbreaker, Kneecapper, and Knuckles Bank) 
- Micro credit has filled part of the void, risk management by group responsibility, e.g. Grameen Bank founded in 1983 by Muhammad Yunus. Both were awarded Nobel Peace Prize in 2006*
- *Yunus has experienced some political and legal problems since but the bank is still operating
