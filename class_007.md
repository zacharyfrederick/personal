# Quiz 6 Revisited
1. What economic issue(s) or problem(s) does Gibbons emphasize in his 1998 NBER paper?
- The ineffective or counterproductive results of applications of the classic agency model of incentives in organizations as noted by such observers as Kerr (“you get what you pay for”)
- The over-emphasis of classic agency incentive models on the trade-offs between insurance and incentives
- The need to address subjective aspects of incentive models in light of the difficulty of measuring contribution or output (y) 
-  All of the above
 
2. The classic agency model of incentives in organizations (often called the sharecropping model) generally posits that the agent is risk averse and her effort is described by a function c(a). Her compensation is portrayed as a linear function: w = s + by where w is the wage, s is the fixed salary and the intercept, and b is the bonus rate and slope of the wage line.   In this general model:
- A higher b indicates a greater incentive for the agent but lower insurance  (i.e. risk sharing)
- Ceteris paribus a higher b indicates the principal bears relatively less risk
- Both of the above
 
3. The classic agency model can be defined so as to reflect major types of contracts. Which is (are) possible depictions?
- Wage labor, no risk imposed on the agent, b=0
- Fixed payment, e.g. land rental, agent bears all crop risk, b =1
- The classic crop sharing arrangement, 0 ≤ b ≤1
- All of the above

4. The “salary” or fixed component, s, of the wage formula may be positive or negative.
- True
- False
5. In many cases, it is impossible to accurately measure individual contribution to output, y  (recall Alchian and Demsetz on team or joint production). In these cases principals may seek to employ a proxy, p, for output. In general a proxy for y is chosen that is more easily observed. Suppose the principle chooses p = number of units as a proxy for y = output value. What sort of distortion(s) might occur?
- The agents might increase units produced but at lower quality leading to lost sales, returns, and lower received price
- The agents’ production might diverge greatly from sales and create inventory problems
- Both of the above 
6. There is a famous, perhaps apocryphal, epigram about production incentives in the Soviet Union: “No one ever stole a lamp from a Soviet Hotel.” Based only on this observation what might you surmise about the incentive system for Soviet lamp factories?
- Lamp factories were evaluated and judged on the market value of the output that they produced.
- Output targets and incentives emphasized the aggregate weight or tonnage of lamps produced.
- Both of the above
# Quiz 6, continued
7. Tournament style incentive systems are those that reward agents in proportion to how they score against a population of similar agents. For example, prize money in golf and tennis tournaments is paid disproportionally to the top few finishers. Mutual fund managers may be viewed as engaged in an annual tournament in which rankings are produced by a number of observers on a roughly quarterly basis with the annual (usually year-end) ranking the most important and influential. Investors follow the rankings and tend to move funds from poor performers to high performers. Since agents’ compensation is usually tied to funds under management, what sort of behavior do you anticipate from those who are “losers” in the early rounds or quarterly rankings?
- Mid-year losers or laggards can be expected to take on additional risk in an effort to boost their positions in the annual return rankings
- The further behind the leaders that a fund manager is, the more aggressively we might expect her to take on additional risk
- Both of the above 
8. Assume that a firm commits to paying a high wage in a difficult job and a low wage in an easy job. Assume further that the worker (agent) believes that investing in skills will result in promotion to the high pay job and will make the investment if the opportunity cost of training is less than the wage increase. The firm will choose to promote the trained worker if the profitability of the trained worker in the difficult job is greater than leaving her in the easy job (productivity in difficult job must exceed that in easy job by more than the wage difference). The investment will pay off if:
- Training is efficient in the sense that its cost is less than the wage differential between the easy and difficult jobs.
- The profitability of the trained worker in the difficult job is greater than leaving her in the easy job (wage difference in the difficult job smaller than the productivity increase)
- Both conditions must be met
# Quiz 6, continued
9. Suppose a firm offers an agent a contract comprising a base salary s and a bonus B if a high contribution is achieved. In a single period employment situation the firm has no economic incentive to pay this bonus.
- True
- False
 
10 In a repeated game version of the bonus contract relationship, B for high performance, the performance of the agent yields an estimate of the future stream of value from maintaining the relationship, PV. We expect that:
- The firm will pay the bonus if PV > B 
- Reneging on the contract means no worker will trust the company and the expected value of the relationship will be very low or zero
- The value of PV is dependent on the expected interest or discount rate 
- All of the above 
# Welcome to the Second Half
In the second half we will:
Refine our understanding of the role of the firm and its boundaries especially in Jewkes (1930), Gibbons (2008), Williamson (1979) and to some degree in Coase (1960)
Investigate alternative rule-based systems for third party compensation and their consequences for social welfare in Coase (1960)
Introduce and explore the significance of information in firm decision making
- Examine our ability to deal with information in Simon (1955, 1991)
- Assess expenditures on information in Stigler (1961)
- Appreciate the need for sufficient information to support transactions and to sustain markets  in Akerlof (1970)
Address product differentiation, a form of specialization, and its contribution to value in Lancaster (1966)
# Boeing, Boeing, Gong
Modern airliners are among the most complex devices ever designed and built
Boeing, one of the world’s two largest aircraft manufacturers, designed the 787 Dreamliner to be a significant advance in aircraft design and manufacture
	- Innovative carbon fiber structural components
	- Substantial increase in fuel efficiency due to lower weight and new engines from GE and RR
	- Outsourcing 60 – 70 percent of component manufacturing, including major vendor design responsibilities
# The Gong Show*
The 787 manufacturing program turned into a disaster:
- Ran more than 3 years late
- Billions wasted on rework and delays
	- Poor fit and rework required
	- Fire on test aircraft
	- Excess weight on early production models
	- Late component deliveries from some vendors
- Some airlines e.g. Japan Airlines cancelled orders due to delays
- Endured strike by company unions
- Boeing had to purchase operations from Vought
	- S.C. operation was underperforming on critical parts
- Boeing spent more than $630 million on Vought facility and share of joint venture with Alenia (Italian subcontractor)
- Fires related to battery system forced grounding of 50 delivered aircraft in 2013
*The Gong Show was an amateur talent show (1976-89). Panelists could end a lousy act by striking a large gong. For alliteration we originally cited the Bong Show – an absurd show featuring a large bong but I decided to forego references to recreational drugs even though they are now legal in many states.
# Gong show continues
Many criticisms of 787 program
- Too complex, too many contractors
- Contractors inexperienced, unfamiliar with new technology
- Boeing CEO with MD background and alien to Boeing culture
- Unions charged that outsourcing was motivated by anti-labor feelings
Boeing has consistently defended the manufacturing strategy
- Admit they were not fully prepared for the change
- Argue that the plane production is now flowing smoothly and the lessons learned will be invaluable in next program
# The Gong Show 
What role did “routines” play in the program?
What happens when company operates in areas without well-defined routines?
Were there elements of entrepreneurial or cognitive limitations?
Was manufacturing strategy entirely based on production cost and efficiency?
- Customer countries
- Vendor investments (risk sharing)
- Home union relations
# Outsourcing
# Internal and External Relationships?
# Factors in Industrial Organization
John Jewkes (1902-1988), neoclassical economist, studied invention, industrial structure, and government planning
Presents the neoclassical position on vertical integration. 
- Free of all the nuanced modern motives of opportunism, hold-up, incomplete contracts, transactions (contracting and governance) costs, etc.
- Applied basic neoclassical tools to the world of the 1930s marked by growing integration in U.S. and fairly stable position in U.K.
- Excellent platform to understand the underlying positions and add later insights.
- In general, there is little incentive for vertical integration in a truly competitive market. Monopoly power may explain some integration while the growth-driven pursuit of new investment may stimulate other cases. 
# Three Alleged Potential Gains from Integration
Seizing of intermediate profits
Technical improvements from integrated or continuous production
- Continuous steel production, some aspects of integrated spinning and weaving
Raw materials security and market access
- Some parts of woolens and cottons
- U.K. automobile builders and iron and steel
- International Paper and Chemicals into publishing
- Iron and steel firms into tinplate
# Integration Inconsistent with Perfect Competition
Theoretically one can buy all they want and sell all they produce at the competitive market clearing price
Capture of intermediate profit 
- If integration takes place through purchase the expected profit would almost certainly be capitalized in acquisition price
- If through new development and investment, must compare to other opportunities, including that in market in which currently engaged
- It’s also very possible to capture the intermediate losses (case of integrated textiles)
Technical fit problem
- No reason to believe that the most efficient scale of production is the same (or an equal multiple) for each stage in the production process
- If different scales are efficient for different stages, then integrated firm is unlikely to achieve overall efficiency
- Rough measure of technical fit is amount of buying/selling of intermediate product(s).
# Technical Fit, Security, Risk, and Adaptation
Chances of technical fit increase as the size of the market increases relative to the “optimal” scale of the plant
The larger the size of the cost-minimizing plant, the more costly will be “self sufficiency”
The greater the scale of the cost minimizing plant and the greater the size of the market, the more likely will be large, specialized producers
Integration exposes firm to additional market risk of input prices (e.g. falling coal prices for integrated electric utilities)
The larger the investment in self-sufficiency, the less flexible the overall operation will tend to be and the more difficult it is to adapt (recall Ford Model T and River Rouge Plant)
Joke in the highly integrated AT&T telephony business post-deregulation, ”Why was God able to build the world in six days?”*
# Technical Fit
# Technical Fit…
Case where efficient cost functions are not multiples of one another, requiring market activity to sell or buy
# Corporate Savings and Integration
Jewkes observed that American firms’ savings rates (retained earnings) were “almost morbid” and seemed to stimulate searches for new investment
In theory, one should return the cash to owners through dividends but that option has been widely ignored by management for eons. *
The longer you sit on a pile of cash, the more pressure you might feel to distribute it to shareholders and so investments in relatively close-in operations may be attractive
It is also likely that the management-driven behavior of looking first to expand is an example of the principal-agent problem 
Even the popularity of stock buy backs has been questioned if executives benefit from higher per share prices
The period in which Jewkes wrote was one of increasing concern about the agency problem, separation of ownership and control, and the sometimes high-handed behavior of management (e.g. Berle and Means, Veblen, et al.)
The crash and depression (1929-1939) undermined faith in the capitalist system and the motives and capabilities of senior management
# Vertical Integration and Adaptation
“…there is not and never will be a unified theory of vertical integration.” – Joskow (1998)
At different times we observe various degrees of vertical integration
- Jewkes (p.628) reported a 46-firm cross section of integration into yarn production indicated no clear pattern
- Once highly integrated industries such as automobiles now have very large supply chains (Recall Stigler industry life cycle)
- Amazon and Google seem to be integrating (or “conglomerating”) well beyond initial markets
- Apple has been considered less diversified than Microsoft but Microsoft is now producing games, phones and tablets 
There have long been semi or partial forms of integration such as joint ventures, cross holdings, etc.
Firms are exploring new sorts of relationships that are not quite integrated, not quite independent (the misappropriated term “ecosystem” is becoming trite)
One potentially useful way to look at integration might be as an adaptive reaction to changes in the environment.
- If so we would expect to see different configurations selected for under different circumstances 
- If the firm really is a locus of contracts, the question is really over the form of those contracts and maybe “make or buy” is too restrictive a way to think about the alignments and roles
# Make, Buy or Cooperate
Today’s class content was outsourced to Robert Gibbons, MIT, Sloan Distinguished Professor of Economics at Sloan School of Management, and Professor of Organizational Economics, Department of Economics http://web.mit.edu/rgibbons/www/
Gibbons recognizes that contracts and relationships are elements of larger set of bonds and rule-based frameworks
Relational contracts are governed by the parties’ individual interests, are not generally court-enforceable, and hence, are more vulnerable to defection 
A great deal of commercial transactions are governed by relational contracts either in lieu of enforceable contracts or as adjuncts to them
The quality of relational contracts, i.e. the incentive for defection, varies depending upon the degree of integration, particularly the ownership of assets
# One-Shot Supply Transaction
# Ongoing Supply Relationship
Very difficult conditions in 1950s and 60s in the can  business.
Crown distinguished itself by establishing relational contracts
- Flexibility within the formal contract
- Willingness to accommodate unusual conditions
- Relied on customer “cooperation” 
Consistent with Williamson (1975) concepts
- Incompleteness of formal contracts (see recent Nobels to Hart and Holmström)
- Relational contracts often enable parties to overcome formal contract problems
- Took place between rather than within companies (potential for opportunistic behavior had been cited as motive for integration)
- Useful model of relational contracts must apply within and between firms (just different points on the spectrum)
# Relational Contracts as Repeated Games
Relational contracts must be “self-enforcing”
Players must choose to “cooperate” on each turn
“Tit-for-tat” is most prominent “trigger strategy” in prisoner dilemma games
- Unforgiving version of TfT is lethal, one misstep and its over
- Rational “defector” will defect only if the one-time gains exceed present value of expected loss
- Defection most probable in expected short term relationship or when discount rates are very high
# Game Insights
The repeated game insight is that the incentive to defect in a relational contract depends largely upon who owns the asset
If Crown owns the asset:
Crown’s threats to sell to Coke met by price from Pepsi of Q>R
Crown may make effort to increase R (value to Coke)
Such efforts may reduce Q e.g. diminishing Pepsi confidence or increase fear of “hold-up”
Pepsi might be incited to buy the can plant but as Hart, et al point out, this exchanges one formal but incomplete contract for another and possible new hold-up
An alternative might be use of informal instrument, relational contracts, with formal instruments to ameliorate the hold-up problem. 
# Game Insights, cont
Assume that Pepsi buys the can plant which becomes then an internal division
Pepsi still desires high quality service, establishes a bonus to the division if it attains Q quality
But now, as owner of the plant, Pepsi can renege on the bonus
Gibbons anticipates student incredulity over a company or one of its divisions screwing over another division and refers to many poorly designed and often reneged upon bonus systems for inventors 
Many division managers will tell you that they prefer to deal with outside companies rather than affiliates
Accounting-based transfer prices and allocated overheads can distort inter-company transactions
Internal labor agreements are not always “relational contracts”
Purchasing the supplier may net you an internal rival, especially when internal incentives are individual profit centers
# The Trade-Off
Upstream ownership provides
- Some recourse if downstream party reneges and thus reduces the incentive to renege
- Also provides incentive to consider third parties’ interests which might create temptation for upstream reneging
- Relative force of these factors varies by situation
- In any case, seeking better informal relational contracts is probably warranted
- Remember that the quality of the relational contract is the objective, the formal integration decision should be made in service to that goal
- Did Boeing “dis-integrate” 787 work in part to avoid hold-up from internal union?
# Next Class
We will discuss the Simon papers on rational decision making
We discuss the broad notion of rational decision making
