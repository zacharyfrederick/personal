- If a worker believes that investing in the relevant skills will yield a promotion to a more difficult and higher paying job he will do so if the difference between the wages in the easy and difficult job is greater than the opportunity cost of the training. True or False?
- The firm will promote a trained worker if doing so is more profitable than leaving her in the easy job, i.e. the productivity difference for a trained worker in the difficult job exceeds her productivity in the easy job and exceeds the wage difference, True or False?
- Are the last two conditions always compatible when training is “efficient,” Yes or No?

# Products, Product Proliferation, Personal Choice
Market oriented economists believe generally that most adults should be free to make their own product choices
Firms offer products (variety) in hopes of being accepted (selection) and rewarded with profit (reproductive advantage)
People’s needs and tastes vary and so firms try to align product characteristics to various segments’ preferences
Our betters (Sen. Sanders, John K. Galbraith, etc.) believe that many of our product choices are unwise or wasteful
Some, such as behavioral economists, seek to “nudge” us in the right direction, others such as Bernie Sanders decry our behavior and some such as Carrie Nation took direct action
# John Kenneth (Ken) Galbraith
Warberg Professor of Economics @ Harvard, Office of Price Control during WWII, Ambassador to India, prolific, popular, and influential author
The Affluent Society (1958) and The New Industrial State (1967) set out a power-based, institutional version of economics 
- Capacity to meet basic needs existed and the old price system market economics no longer described the economy
- Large corporations were able to manage their markets and secure stable environment for their investments
- “Want management” through advertising and other means ensured steady and increasing demand often by creating trivial and unnecessary new products
- Market power and integration stabilized input prices
- Technostructure supplanted shareholders as drivers of firms
- Large corporation power called for countervailing power from government, unions
Gave intellectual cover to people who decried product proliferation, advertising, executive salaries, blamed corporations for persistence of poverty, etc.
Galbraith (not Elizabeth Warren despite what she says) provided much of the intellectual foundation for many anti-market, anti-capitalist, anti-globalization groups such as Occupy Wall Street. 
One of the few economists dismissed by both Milton Friedman and Paul Krugman
 
# Complex and Multi-Characteristic Goods
Lancaster notes that the neoclassical theory of consumer behavior is elegant but sterile
- Does not accommodate intrinsic characteristics of goods
- No way of handling complementarity until Morishima (1959)
- New good required resetting general equilibrium models at n+1 products
- Side note: Hazel Kyrk ‘s(1886-1957), PhD University of Chicago, dissertation was printed under the same selection process supported by Hart, Schaffner and Marx that published Frank Knight’s dissertation. She was one of the first economists to look at consumption theory as a process. Dr. Kirk is thought by some to be a pioneer in consumer economics and a forerunner of feminist economics. 
# Neoclassical Consumer Behavior
# Lancaster: Goods are Bundles of Characteristics
Lancaster departed from the traditional consumer theory model by
decomposing goods and utility into more basic elements:
A good, per se, does not give utility to a consumer; it possesses characteristics and those characteristics give rise to utility. 
Goods generally possess multiple characteristics and many of those characteristics are shared by more than one good. 
- Characteristics of an automobile might include horsepower, seating capacity, exterior color, etc. 
Combining goods may produce characteristics different from those possessed by the goods separately. 
- Combining good food and good service may create a memorable dining experience. 
New combinations of product characteristics results in new goods
         There are many examples of this in nature. At normal temperatures both hydrogen and oxygen are gases but combined in 2:1 proportion they form a liquid called water. Decomposition often provides new insights. Compounds are made of molecules, molecules are made up of atoms, atoms are made up of electrons, protons, and (except for hydrogen) neutrons. Protons and neurons  are in turn made up of various quarks.
# Activity Analysis, Consumption Technology and Satisfaction Vectors
Lancaster applied a form of activity analysis, long used in production
analysis, to describe the transformation of goods into characteristics.
He thus introduced the notion of consumption technology.
Goods then become satisfaction vectors defined in terms of the quantities of characteristics, z, intrinsic to them. 
Consumption of good X gives rise to increasing levels of both characteristic Z1 and Z2. 
- The slope of the line (shown by our old friends rise and run) reflects the consumption technology, B, and displays the proportions of the characteristics intrinsic to good X.  
- In the example on next slide, consuming an additional unit of good X increases the amount of characteristic Z1 somewhat more than characteristic Z2.  
Goods, x, are transformed into characteristics, z, by consumption technology, B, where z=Bx. B can have any shape but life is easier if we restrict it to being linear. 
# Mapping Goods Vector to Characteristics
Suppose characteristic Z1 is taste or yummy-ness 
and characteristic Z2 is healthiness or 
low-calorie-ness. Good X is relatively high in 
yummy-ness and lower in low-calorie-ness. Then 
good X may be in the major (and my favorite)
food group: high-fat, high-calorie ice cream.
But, alas, man cannot live by cardiac-arrest-
threatening ice cream alone so we observe that 
there are many food goods distinguished 
by their proportions of taste and healthiness. 
How can we choose how  much of each to buy?
# Comparing Goods
Introduce another good, X1, (and label our original good X0)  a unit of which converts into relatively less characteristic Z1, yummy-ness, and relatively more Z2, healthiness. 
- This new good might be low-fat, sugar free ice cream (possibly the worst food ever invented).  
- With two goods to choose from, we need to establish the price line or terms of trade between the two goods. The price ratio line shows how much additional good X0 we can get if we give up some X1 and vice versa. 
As shown on next slide, if the consumer spent all of her budget on food X0 she could buy the amount 0 with its associated characteristics of Z0 and Z1 and if she spent all of it on food X1 she could buy 1 with its different levels of Z0 and Z1. 
Consumers can create their own bundles of goods X0 and X1 and corresponding sets of characteristics Z1 and Z2 by moving along the price line exactly as they did in the simpler neoclassical model – they find a point of tangency of the their utility curve and the price line. 
# Two Goods plus a Budget Line
# Utility Maximization and Consumption Technology
The introduction of the consumer indifference curve and the
determination of the efficient bundle are illustrated
below. The point of tangency between the indifference
curve,U1, and the price line indicates the amount of
each good the consumer will buy and, through the
consumption technology B, enjoy characteristics Z1
and Z2.
The  price line is positioned
on the points of the vectors where all of 
the consumer’s income is spent on each good. 
The slope of the resulting line
is equal to the price ratio of the two goods
(just like the traditional representation).
It is important to realize that the lower the price of 
a good, the farther out will be the point of maximum
consumption. 
# Efficient Consumption Frontier
Next we introduce more goods and the price lines between them to illustrate the concept of the efficient consumption frontier which has implications for product design, marketing, and advertising.
Since there are four goods, there are six price lines, each connecting a pair of goods vectors. 
- The efficient consumption frontier is made up of the price lines that dominate in their region. 
- By dominance, we mean that any position on one of the dashed price lines could be improved by moving to a solid price line up and to the right. 
- For example, if you are at the point between goods 1 and 2 denoted by the open circle you could have more Z1 and just as much Z2 by moving to the point denoted by the shaded circle.  
Four (n) things taken two (r) at a time produce 6 combinations: n!/r!(n-r)!
# Efficient Consumption Frontier…
# Utility Maximization and Consumption Technology
Finally, we re-introduce the consumer’s utility curve and find the point of tangency that determines the bag of goods she buys in order to maximize her utility from their combined characteristics.
Lancaster’s complex or multi-characteristic goods make clear that consumption is an active process by which consumers achieve higher levels of utility by combining characteristics of the goods that they can acquire in the marketplace. 
- The notion of complex goods has a number of important implications in management especially in product design, marketing and advertising.
- To understand customer choices, managers have to understand the weighting customers give to each characteristic. Choices are not between hotel A and hotel B so much as between location (near town or airport), amenities (free Internet or breakfast buffet), etc.  
- Discrete choice models, employing conjoint and logit analytical techniques, is used to estimate customer evaluations of alternative bundles of characteristics are consistent with Lancaster’s perspective.
Product design should focus on the underlying characteristics that the customer is seeking to create by combining products. 
# New Goods and Prices
Three initial goods, G1, G2, and G3 with varying proportions of 
characteristics Z1 and Z2 indicated by the slopes of their satisfaction vectors.  
The original efficient substitution frontier is ABC and some customers 
consume combinations of G1 and G2 while others consume combinations 
of G2 and G3 depending upon their utility functions.
New good G4 is introduced with proportions of characteristics 
as shown. New consumption bundles will depend on the price 
and hence substitution ratios. 
 
- If the new good’s price is too high – inside of point D – then the new 
- good will be dominated by the existing efficient frontier and fail to sell
 
- If the new good price lies on AB – at D – then some people who 
- previously used combination of G1 and G2 may now be indifferent 
- between their old combinations or some new combinations of
- G1 and G4 or G4 and G2
 
- If the price of G4 is a little lower, it will push the efficient frontier out,
- say to D1, and there new combinations of G1 and G4 or G4 and G2 
- will replace old combinations of G1 and G2
 
- If the price of G4 is even lower, resulting in Dll, then combinations of 
- G4 and G3 would dominate G2 which would be replaced in the market
 
- Finally, at a very low G4 price such as Dlll combinations of G4 and G3 would 
- continue to dominate and eliminate G2 and G4 alone dominate all possible
- combinations with G1  (due to the positive sloped substitution line)
 
# Product Proliferation and Advertising are Good for the Universe
Product differentiations that generate profitable sales improve welfare by pushing the efficient substitution frontier out, enabling customers to more efficiently combine desired characteristics
Lancaster points out that advertising can be efficient and productive; particularly when dealing with complex multi-characteristic goods that require more information to explain.
- So long as the greater utility gained by making the customer aware of the option exceeds the cost of advertising, the customer and society are better off
# Product Proliferation, Advertising and Choice Anxiety*
Why was Bernie Sanders disturbed by the number of deodorant choices? He thinks there are 23. Way wrong,  Amazon sells 10,005 choices and many brands.
# Summary of Lancasterian Model
# Revealed Preference: How can we tell what consumers value?
Revealed preference introduced in 1938 by the late Nobel Laureate economist Paul Samuelson 
Motivated to explain consumer behavior without depending upon the vaporous notion of utility. 
Didn’t succeed in removing psychology but set out a firm basis for empirical analyses of observed behavior.
- “The discrediting of utility as a psychological concept robbed it of its only possible virtue as an explanation of human behavior in other than a circular sense, revealing its emptiness as even a construction. …
- “I propose, therefore, that we start anew in direct attack upon the problem, dropping off the last vestiges of the utility analysis.” …(emphasis in original)
Samuelson summarized his concept with a common sense observation that evolved later into the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference (WARP)
- “. . . if an individual selects batch one over batch two, he does not at the same time select two over one.”
Samuelson, Paul A., “A Note on the Pure Theory of Consumer’s Behavior” 1938, Economica, pp61-70 reprinted in The Collected
Scientific Papers of Paul A. Samuelson, 1966, edited by Joseph E Stiglitz, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp3-14
# Revealed Preference
Following Varian* we can express Revealed Preference and
WARP technically as: 
Revealed Preference  
Given some vectors of prices and chosen bundles (pt, xt) for t
=1, . . . , T , we say xt is directly revealed preferred to a bundle 
(written xtRDx) if ptxt ≥ ptx. We say xt is revealed preferred to x
(written xtRx) if there is some sequence r,s,t,...,u,v such that prxr
≥ prxs, psxs ≥ psxt,···,puxu ≥ pux. In this case, we say the relation R
is the transitive closure of the relation RD.

and the 21st Century, edited by Michael Szenberg. This is moderately accessible and available online at:

# Weak Axiom Of Revealed Preference (WARP)
If xtRDxs then it is not the case that xsRDxt. Algebraically, ptxt ≥ ptxs implies psxs < psxt.
Assume the two relative price or budget lines for goods X and X1 illustrated next slide.  
- The consumer can buy any bundle or set of the two goods on the appropriate price line as well as any bundle or set of goods interior to the line. 
- If the consumer initially faces the less steeply sloping price line and chooses bundle a and behaves rationally, we can make certain observations about what happens when the relative prices of the goods change.
-  The steeper budget line indicates that the price of good X has increased relative to that of X1 (at the new prices, the consumer’s income could buy less of X but more of X1 than previously). 
When faced with the new prices, the consumer could choose (among many others) bundle b or c. But c is inconsistent with the conditions of revealed preference. 
- Note that c is interior to the original price line and thus could have been purchased under the initial conditions but wasn’t. 
- On the other hand, point a is interior to the new price line and the selection of b is therefore consistent with the WARP.
# Revealed Preference Graphically
# Revealed Preference Applications
Though several economists, notably Amartya Sen, reject the premises of revealed preference, it is embodied in several popular tools for analyzing customer preferences, e.g.
- Choice Analysis, seeks to estimate customer preferences for product attributes by “offering” different sets of attributes
	- E.g. Rank hotel configuration: free Wi-Fi, near airport vs. free breakfast, downtown
- Conjoint Analysis, technique for evaluating the basis of  customer choices among various combinations
	- E.g. Would you choose: non-stop flight, major carrier $100 or one-stop, budget carrier flight $50
The initial Samuelson revealed preference theory is now labeled “traditional” (TRCT) and a modified form is called “current” (CRCT) or neo-Samuelson. 
Revealed Preference is also the theoretical basis for many “big data” analyses of historical data

All customers are not created equal. Focus efforts on two characteristics;
customers with high relationship value and those with a potential propensity to purchase our good or service. i.e. those amenable to a relationship.
