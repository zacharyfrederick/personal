# The Economics of Business
# Alchian and Demsetz, Production, Information Costs, and Economic Organization
Alchian and Demsetz emphasized the importance of cooperation as an explanation of firms
- Productivity increases through cooperative team-based production  (different from hierarchy) 
- Demand for organizations to facilitate that cooperation 
- More detailed picture than Coase, they sought to:
	- Explain the conditions when cooperative specialization benefited from organization or market
	- Explain the structure of the organization
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Argued that Coase overstated power of hierarchy over the market
- Firms do not own all of their resources
- Firm’s power to deploy and discipline no greater than through market 
- Cooperative activities (teams) are difficult and costly to meter (manage)
-  
# Alchian and Demsetz
A team or joint production function: z = f(x,y) is described mathematically by non-zero second cross partial derivatives: ∂f2/∂x∂y ≠ 0.
- E.g. if z = f(x,y) = x3 + x2y3 -2y2 , then
	- fx = 3x2 + 2xy3, and  
	- fxfy =∂/∂y (3x2 + 2xy3) = 6xy2  for all x,y ≠ 0
- But, if z = f(x,y) = x3 – 2y2 then 
- 	 fx = 3x2  , and
- 	 fxfy = ∂/∂y (3x2) = 0
- Note: This is a little friendly warm-up or warning shot exercise. If you find this incomprehensible your calculus is probably not up to dealing with some future articles such as Klepper
- Note 2: Jensen and Meckling argue that this condition is not necessary to the Alchian and Demsetz case
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Team production makes shirking difficult to observe
 
People are more prone to shirk as a team member than in tasks involving separable work
Manager seeks to minimize shirking subject to costs of metering (therefore an optimal level of shirking)
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Firm (or principal) is the common contracting party for all team members
Centralized contracting is important characteristic of firm
- Reduces re-contracting costs
- Promotes familiarity and knowledge to better observe and   counteract shirking
Managers and executives are responsible for metering their subordinates but Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? 
- Literally "Who will guard the guards themselves?"
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Manager rewarded and incented by claim on the residual value created by the team
Jensen and Meckling point out that as the owner-manager’s share of the residual declines from 100% an agency problem emerges with respect to the outside shareholders and her incentive and effort to maximize value declines.*

# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
The classical firm* is defined as a contractual structure characterized by:
Joint input production involving ->
Several input owners 
One party common to all the contracts of the joint inputs who ->
Has rights to renegotiate any input's contract independently of contracts with other input owners;
Holds the residual claim; and
Who has the right to sell his central contractual residual status. 
	-         The central agent (principal) is called the firm's owner and/or the   employer
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Alchian and Demsetz see limits to firm scale consistent with Coase but more specific than simply a generic recourse to diminishing returns to management. 
- The greater the interdependencies among functions, and the needs for specialized knowledge to manage those interdependencies, the more important is centralized contracting
-  The larger a firm and the more different bodies of knowledge it must master to manage interdependencies, the more difficult and expensive it becomes to perform efficiently.
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Firms may take many financial and organizational forms.
Firm type is defined by intensity or alignment of residual sharing arrangements
- Profit Sharing Firms
- Socialist Firms
- The Corporation
- Mutual and Non-profit Firms
- Partnerships
- Employee Unions (not firms but monitoring service)
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Profit sharing firms* are generally found in small team size settings 
- Facilitates self-policing for small teams (non-specialist monitoring)
- Under equal profit sharing schemes incentives to shirk directly related to the size of the team 
- Within large firms, equal sharing diffuses incentives of management (one reason you don’t often see this form in large companies.
* Pure profit sharing firms in this case are those that distribute rewards more or less uniformly across employees more-or-less independent of contribution. Many firms that distribute a bit of profit to many employees call themselves profit sharing. This is by far the most common practice.
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Socialist firms often marked by broad sharing of residual value (if any)
- Managers have no special claim on residual and therefore lack incentive
- Proxies for residual; e.g. goals, evaluations, etc. are used
- Worker evaluations of management, where used, may encourage management tolerance of shirking
	- “We pretend to work, they pretend to pay us.”*
Old urban legend with fair amount of truth about Soviet incentive systems:
	Once upon a time, there was a factory in the Soviet Union that made nails. Unfortunately, Moscow set quotas on their nail production, and they began working to meet the quotas as described, rather than doing anything useful. When they set quotas by quantity, they churned out hundreds of thousands of tiny, useless nails. When Moscow realized this was not useful and set a quota by weight instead, they started building big, heavy railroad spike-type nails that weighed a pound each. https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22375/did-a-soviet-nail-factory-produce-useless-nails-to-improve-metrics 
* Old Soviet-era joke about workers’ and management’s indifference to effort
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Corporations are marked by diffuse ownership
- Small shareholders have little incentive to meter
- Liquidity limits their risk
Managers are policed to some extent by
- Internal competition for the brass ring
- Potential change of ownership (raiders, LBOs, etc)
Perhaps better to view stockholders as investors, not owners (How would the SEC react to this?)
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Mutual and non-profit firms
- No market valuation
- Often compensated on “comparable” basis
- Rewarded for “inputs”*
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Partnerships
- Frequently used for jointly produced artistic and intellectual productions 
- Small scale permits self-policing
- Often formed among relatives or friends
- Once common in “professional services” but replaced by LLCs to limit liability
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Employee unions
- Not firms, usually don’t create tradable products and services
- Do provide monitoring services for members
- Some provide training, hiring hall, and insurance services
- Serious agency problems with respect to members in some cases

# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Input ownership
- Ownership typically resides where expected returns are greatest 
- Asset ownership arrangements are very similar to share-cropping contracts – basic form of risk-sharing contracting
- Costs of asset use include depreciation and loss of service due to carelessness
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Firms will own those assets they can economically apply and monitor (owner absorbs financial and physical depreciation)
Centralized monitoring of abuse worthwhile for expensive physical assets
- Typically owned by company
- May be rented if cost, including premium for expected abuse, is lower than ownership costs
Asset ownership has become viewed as a means to avoid “hold-up” and to exercise control over users
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Employees will own assets if best able to realize the value of their service and protect them from abuse 
Workman can more easily monitor abuse of his tools
Dedicated but abuse-vulnerable assets, even trucks, are often employee owned
Specialized tools of the trade frequently owned by workers
# Alchian and Demsetz, continued
Firm as a Specialized Market Institution for Collecting, Collating, and Selling Information
Firm can be considered a “private market”
Nuanced contrast to Coase “substitute for the market”
Firm is in position to evaluate and direct resources better than those resources could on their own
Resources may find it better to work (sell their services) within a private market (firm) than through the public markets
Analogous to the private market of a department store
Efficient production with heterogeneous inputs
Do public markets suffer from communal ownership?
# Harold Demsetz, The Theory of the Firm Revisited*
 
Follow-up to earlier work with Alchian
Observes need for greater emphasis on information in explaining firms
Describes the failure of “perfect decentralization” model to explain firms
Discusses some problems with Transaction Cost Economics (TCE)
*Harold Demsetz, 1988, “The Theory of the Firm Revisited,” Journal of Law, Economics and Organization, pp. 141-161
# Harold Demsetz, Revisited…
Moral Hazard, Shirking and Opportunism
- Attention turned to incentive alignment
- Dealing with moral hazard involves costs
- Close ties between asset specificity and opportunism
- Firm-like production results in a special form of productivity
# Harold Demsetz, Revisited…
Firm-Like Organization
- “The firm properly viewed is a ‘nexus’ of contracts.” (derived from Jensen and Meckling)
- Questions involve:
	- The persistence of certain types of contracts
	- The variation in other types of contracts that are “more-or-less” included in the nexus
	- The (horizontal and vertical) scope of activities covered by these contracts
We have now the tensions among forces shaping relationships
- Specialization (idiosyncrasy) increases productivity but also vulnerability
- Cooperative, team-based output (through either firm or contract) to achieve benefits of specialization
- Human nature gives rise to moral hazard, opportunism, shirking, etc. and requires management
# George Stigler, The Division of Labor is Limited by the Extent of the Market
 
Title is borrowed from Adam Smith’s profound observation
David Ricardo (1772-1823), Nassau Senior (1790-1864), , and J.S. Mill (1806-1863) observed the phenomenon of industrial increasing returns
Dilemma or fear: If further division of labor continuously lowers costs for larger outputs then entrepreneurs could expand and monopolize industries (why doesn’t this happen?)
Decreasing cost functions and increasing returns to scale were troublesome concepts and neglected because the intellectual basis for examining them was inadequate
In 1928 Allyn Young re-emphasized Smith’s theorem but couldn’t successfully integrate into the theory of the firm
# George Stigler, The Division of Labor is Limited by the Extent of the Market…
Stigler observed the “life cycle” of firms from fully vertically integrated to more focused entities and then re-integrating as the industry declined
 An evolutionary concept analogous to species interacting with their environment or habitat (not stated as such by Stigler)
 Firms may be seen as performing a series of distinct (separable and additive) operations or production functions (see following graphic)
Highly vertically integrated firms often engage in operations with an assortment of production cost curve shapes
These operations can be defined in terms of common rates of output and therefore summed vertically to arrive at a total cost curve
In the beginning stages of an industry there may not be a “make-or-buy” option, so firms will produce all required operations.
As market grows, specialist firms may enter, usually in declining cost operations where they can achieve higher volumes and lower costs and sell to the integrated firms are prices lower than they can achieve on their own.

Vertical integration may also be efficient when the market or price system does not clear at MC of the product and Marginal-Value Product.* WWII price controls stimulated many mergers among primary materials and material using firms:
# George Stigler, The Division of Labor is Limited by the Extent of the Market…
Outsourcing – think of it as vertical de-integration
- Outsourcing is simply buying rather than making – the original Coasian choice 
- Stigler’s life cycle or evolutionary model can explain some outsourcing
- Much (most?) outsourcing is compelled by market forces and not particularly discretionary
- Society’s overall wealth increases with the increase in specialization
- Some people may be hurt 
- In some “clusters” the existence of a commonly accessible sources for decreasing cost operations makes it much easier to start new specialized firms.
Supplier chains and networks. Many, if not most, technology companies purchase most of their components and many services from other firms.
