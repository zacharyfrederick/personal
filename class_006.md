# Economics of Business 
# Quiz 5 - Williamson
Williamson applied his transaction cost approach to what dimensions or levels of the firm?
- Firm type, internal reporting structure, and management control
- Overall structure, activities within operating parts (e.g. efficient boundaries of operating units), organization and governance of human assets.
- Corporate (headquarters), divisions, functional or professional units
- None of the above
The antecedents to Williamson’s transaction cost approach include:
- John R. Commons, early institutional economist, first advanced the notion that the transaction is the basic unit of economic analysis
- Ronald Coase held that the boundary of the firm was a decision variable subject to economic analysis
- Friedrich Hayek observed that high performance economies were distinguished by their efficient adaptation to uncertainty
- All of the above
What three dimensions does Williamson use to describe transactions?
- Scale, risk, and asset durability
- Uncertainty, frequency, and asset specificity
- Duration of transaction, scale, and ownership structure
- None of the above
# Quiz 5, continued
4. Williamson argues that operations or transactions generally fall into a limited number of categories.
- Core transactions, frequently site-specific, for which no detailed analysis is needed
- A group of transactions for which market ownership and provision is manifestly superior
- A set of transactions calling for make-or-buy analysis
- All of the above
- None of the above
 
5. Physical asset specificity is valued because demand is increased by design or performance characteristics.
- False, it is almost always more efficient to buy standardized assets
- True, in some cases the unique or specific character of the asset is necessary to achieve a desired output or functionality
- It depends
 
6. In some cases, realizing valued demand results or characteristics comes with greater production expenses.
- True, standardized items procured through the market might be cheaper but not capable of achieving the desired demand characteristics
- False, market production and exchange is almost always more economical than internal or “make” options
# Quiz 5, continued
7.Governance costs, like production costs, vary with respect to the degree of asset specificity because:
- As specificity increases, the market’s aggregation benefits diminish and transactions take on more of a bilateral character with its increased governance cost
- As assets take on a highly specific character, internal organization and governance will displace market governance
- Both of the above
 
8. Williamson extends his model to the issue of human asset governance. He concentrates on two characteristics of human assets:
- The degree of uncertainty in judging their performance and the level of productivity
- Degree of firm specificity and ease of productivity measurement
- Neither of the above
 
9. If an employee’s skills are not particularly firm-specific and his or her efforts are relatively easy to measure, he or she would be likely be subject to what sort of governance?
- Primitive team
- Relational team
- Spot market
- Obligational market
 
10. Williamson extends his discussion of human asset governance to cover union or collective organization. His application of transaction cost analysis to this case yields what general predictions?
- Incentive to organize production workers within collective structure and the degree to which internal governance structure is elaborated varies directly with the degree of human asset specificity
- Union power to control job design will vary with respect to the human asset specificity of workers
- Both of the above
 
# Previous Class: internal vs market production
The progression from market to internal
provision can be described algebraically:
Let ∆C = f(A) the production cost difference between internal and market 
Let ∆G = g(A) the governance cost difference between internal and market
- If  ∆C +  ∆G > 0 market transactions are advantaged
- If  ∆C +  ∆G = 0 the firm is indifferent between market and internal provision
- If  ∆C +  ∆G < 0 internal production is advantaged over market
- In short, the more specific the good or service, the more likely it is be produced internally

- Hard to assess inter temporal trade-offs
*Should probably be called enlightened self-interest.
# Rational Choice Theory (RCT)
Aggregate social behavior reflects the individual behaviors and choices made in light of individual, self-determined preferences by rational actors.
Individual preferences are complete in the sense that the person can rank and decide among all options presented. Those preferences are transitive in the normal sense that if A is preferred to B and B to C, A is preferred to C.
Individuals take account of available information, the probabilities of outcomes, and the expected costs and benefits of outcomes when choosing among options. 
Individuals act consistently and previous choices are relevant to current decisions though people’s tastes may change or evolve due to experience, education, or changes in the menu of choices.
# Principal-Agent Problem, Asymmetric Information, and Incentives
Classical model did not distinguish explicitly motives of principals and agents (although Smith and others were very aware of the problem)
Alchian and Demsetz define managers’ role and incentive to avoid shirking in terms of claim on “residual” created by teams (but don’t address how to structure the linkage). Their model is often called an “agency” approach.
Agency theory is directed at the conflicts or tensions in the ubiquitous superior-subordinate relationship
One party (the principal) delegates work to another (the agent), who performs that work. The agent maximizes her utility which rarely coincides entirely with that of the principal.
The agent typically has an asymmetric information advantage that facilitates her shirking. Principals devote effort and expense to reducing the information advantage but rarely eliminate it.
Principals turn to compensation structures to align better the agents’ efforts with the principals’ goals. 
The economic issue is: what form of compensation or incentive structure most efficiently aligns the interests and efforts of the agent and principal?
# Principal-Agent Problem, Asymmetric Information, and Incentives…
Agency theory is concerned with resolving two problems: 
- The desires or goals of the principal and agent conflict and 
- It is difficult or expensive for the principle to verify what the agent is actually doing 
As usual, Adam Smith was aware of the problem:
…and the wages of labor are everywhere understood to be, what they usually are, when the labourer is one person, and the owner of the stock which employs him another. What are the common wages of labour, depends everywhere upon the contract usually made between those two parties, whose interests are by no means the same. The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as little as possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to raise, the latter in order to lower the wages of labour (emphasis added)1
1Adam Smith, 1776, The Wealth of Nations, Book One, Chapter 8
# Smith and the Agency Problem
In Smith’s time a “copartnery” was similar to a modern partnership
- Illiquid - shares could be transferred only by consent of the company
- Partners are each bound for the copartnery’s debts up to the extent of his fortune
A “joint stock company” was established by royal charter or act of parliament
- Typically these companies enjoyed a monopoly on trade or commerce
- They tended to be very inefficient
- Very few succeeded, most failed
Liability was limited, encouraging investors to “hazard their fortunes” much more than they would in a private copartnery.
- Exemption “from trouble and from risk, beyond a limited sum, encourages many people to become adventurers in joint-stock companies who would upon no account, hazard their fortunes in any private copartnery.”
Smith probably had in mind the notorious British East India Company (1600-1874)
# Smith on Agency Problem, continued
# Dimensions of the Principal Agent Problem
Agents possess an informational advantage (also referred to as asymmetric information) over the principal. Thus the principal can almost never be completely aware of the agent’s actions. 
People at various levels in the hierarchy and locations in the firm have different amounts and quality of information. 
People with an informational advantage are tempted and sometimes succumb to the urge to game the system, or worse, criminally abuse it.
To deal with the problem of differential information firms often invest substantially in control and monitoring systems (in some cases this spurs an evolutionary arms race)
Effort to extend the boundary of diminishing returns to management or free up time to pursue other objectives
# Dimensions of the Principal Agent Problem
Costs associated with agents failing to maximize their efforts on behalf of the principal are called “agency costs” and the general problem is sometimes called the “agency dilemma.”
The modern approach posits separate utility functions for the owners (principals) and their managers or employees (agents).
External, unplanned, and random events beyond the manager’s control may influence greatly the results of his efforts or make them difficult to measure. (recall Alchian, 1950) 
# Dimensions of the Principal-Agent Problem…
Prevention can be thought of as a type of “control”
- First line of defense is to employ better agents. Georgia Governor Lester Maddox (1967-71), concerned about prison riots declared, “The problem is the that we need a better class of prisoner.”1
- People tend to inflate credentials (e.g. George O’Leary at ND in 2001)
- Prevention costs seem to be declining as databases become more accessible
Control
- Technology aided control systems increase management and labor productivity
- Sometimes encourage colleagues to spy and inform on one another to offset management’s asymmetric information disadvantage. 
Bounties (after the fact)
- U.S. whistle blower system
- $104 million pay-off to Birkenfeld
- Michael Sandler doesn’t use this example of market corrupting motives

# Dimensions of the Principal-Agent Problem…
A second order effect of control is that the more extensive the control system: 
- The higher the compliance costs, the greater the power of the controllers, the more likely is smeergeld and steekpenning* 
- Give people control over a saleable asset and they will sell it
- Public Choice Theory, founded by Buchanan and Tullock portrays government officials and politicians as utility-maximizing people just like consumers and producers  (Public Interest Theory taught in school assumes public officials always act in the public interest. This is contrary to common sense and evidence.)
Principals will invest in control systems up to the point where the expected incremental cost of additional control just equals the avoided loss due to opportunism
Principals who do not personally have a lot at stake or who are subject to clumsy budget systems will often fail to align incremental costs of loss and expenditure on prevention (e.g. NSA and Snowden; Office of Personnel Records hack, etc.)

# Incentives and the Agency Problem
- Kerr provides a litany of counter-productive and sometimes perverse behaviors stimulated by poorly designed incentive systems
# Kerr offers four reasons
Fascination with an “objective” criterion
Over emphasis on highly visible behavior
Hypocrisy
Emphasis on morality or equity rather than efficiency
# Designing Incentives- The Basics of Money versus Leisure
Assume a max 16 hour workday, three successively higher
indifference curves (I1, I2, I3 ), three successively greater
income lines (Y1, Y2, Y3) reflecting corresponding money
wages and find three points of tangency:
 
# Designing Incentives- The Basics of Money and Leisure…
Identifying hours worked (Wi = 16-Hi) for each income line, we can plot a labor
supply curve as a function of wages, Mi, associated with each income line in
previous slide:
# Designing Incentives- The Basics of Money and Leisure 
We add 3 new money income and
indifference curves, causing the 
hours of leisure to first decline and
then to increase. To extent that 
many people have this sort of 
preference, it explains in part why rich
country work weeks are shorter than
developing country work weeks. 
#  Agent-Principal Incentive Model
Assumptions:
The Principal (owner, entrepreneur, executive, etc.) retains the profit or wealth maximizing objective and utility function. (Recall the motivating factor in Alchian and Demsetz)
Agents i.e. people within the firm have different values and hence different utility functions expressing their personal trade-offs
The principal seeks to provide the agent incentives to align his or her effort to the benefit of the principal
The agent can perform some act or function which advances the principal’s interest but at a cost to herself (pain, loss of leisure…) 
The agent often enjoys an informational advantage that enables her to mask her actions or to better understand the alternatives facing the firm.
This asymmetric information position is key to moral hazard of opportunism and the need for management control systems
# Agent-Principal Incentive Divergence
The conflict in objectives is shown for a case where the agent perceives reward for both profitability and employee count (e.g. the old Hay points)
The profit maximizing agent would operate at point B, the utility maximizing agent goes beyond to C
# The Sharecropping Model
Perhaps the oldest form of risk-sharing model and still in wide use
Basic model involves a land-owner (principal) and a tenant farmer
Following Gibbons, we assume that the production function defines output, y, as a function of agent effort, a, plus an exogenous shock term, e : 
                                      y= a + e
# The Sharecropping Model
The principal offers the agent a contract where total compensation, w equals a salary component, s, and bonus rate b applied to output y;  this is a linear equation:
                                       w = s + by
Now the principal’s profit is y-w which of course he seeks to maximize e.g. find the greatest difference between y and w considering both the agent’s contribution to y and his compensation
# The Sharecropping Model…
The agent seeks to maximize the difference between her expected wage based on y and the cost of her effort a. I.e. she seeks to maximize her pay-off:  w-c(a). 
# The Sharecropping Model….
The intercept, s, or fixed salary does not vary with respect to output so it does not influence the level of effort and hence output.
s does influence the agent’s employment decision by reducing risk of taking the job. If s ≤ 0, the agent bears the risk of total failure 
The steeper the wage curve, e.g. higher b, the greater the share of output that goes to the agent and, ceteris paribus, the more incentive she has to put forth effort 
The principal will not pay knowingly a bonus rate that results in his expected profits being less than his own opportunity costs e.g. y-w ≥ P (opportunity cost)
Contracts may have a negative s which is a fee for the right to operate the franchise 
# The Fallacy of Purely Objective Compensation
There is a strong flavor of Pavlovian and Skinnerian stimulus-response thinking in some incentive schemes. Skinnerian model is bad biology and bad economics.
Many people believe that only very well-defined and strictly enforced contracts are effective means to govern almost all internal and external relationships and transactions. 
- Those people are ignoring or ignorant of asymmetrical information and monitoring costs
- People do not respond exclusively to quantitative or objective incentives
As Kerr points out, unintended consequences often seem the rule in incentive compensation.* Gibbons notes: 
- H.J. Heinz; gaming the accounting of sales 
- Dun & Bradstreet, misleading the clients
- Sears Automotive, inflating the repairs
- Fund management distortion
- Job Training Partnership, skew trainee selection 
Recent Wells Fargo fake customer accounts debacle may be a classic case
# The Sharecropper Model…
If direct contribution to output or profit is not observable, principals may use objective proxies; e.g.                      w= s + bp  where p is a proxy for y   
The closer p is to y, the more efficient the system, in the sense of alignment, but if p diverges from y, the agent’s behavior will likely become misaligned with the principal’s objective 
# Incentive Systems…
In many cases, the difficulty of measuring precisely y and people’s contribution to it is so great that a system of modest bonuses and subjective evaluations is superior to a strict “by the numbers” approach.
- Baker showed that under some relationships of p to y, it was impossible to determine optimal incentives = social marginal benefits
- Under many cases of uncertainty, it is also impossible to create an incentive in which marginal agent action = marginal social value
- “Tournament” models, in which agents compete for a prize can lead to sabotage as well as effort.
- Impossible to contract on single agent’s contribution to team value (recall joint input problem)
Introduction of private or multiple objectives shows how managers may focus on private gains 
# Incentive Systems…
Gibbons summarized his interim judgment on objective performance systems thus:
- Objective performance measures typically cannot be used to create ideal incentives
- Efficient bonus rates are consequently often small
- Small or modest bonus rates can create useful incentives if agents have few distractions, therefore job design may be an important complement to incentive contracting
# Incentive Systems and Relationships
Various forms of relational contracts* involving subjective performance assessment can be effective with or in place of enforceable contracts
Desire(s) to maintain the relationship (repeated game)
- Worker is paid base salary plus conditional bonus depending on high or low contribution
- Company has no economic or commercial incentive to pay in a single period game 
- In multi-period game, the discounted value of the contribution is critical
	- Low interest rates, high incentive to maintain relationship, pay larger bonus 
	- High interest rates, NPV of contribution is smaller, may result in low bonus or reneging 
*recall Williamson’s taxonomy of employee characteristics and governance structures
# Promises and Skill Investments
Promises (or potential) of raises or promotions may be an incentive to invest in skills
		- Worker must expect increase in wages to have NPV greater than opportunity cost of investment
		- Company must expect value of increased productivity to exceed the cost of the higher wages
Consider situation where the employee and employer are considering investment in employee skill(s)
# Complementary Incentives to Invest in Skills…
                
# Conditional Promises
Some form of conditional promises may discourage investment in skills and may waste human capital (e.g. some up-or-out policies)
- Promotional promises may waste little acquired skill of those not promoted
- Up-or-out often wastes acquired skills
Gibbons’ contract forms may be used for both internal and external contracts and are consistent with the determination of firm boundaries by Williamson
# Business Roundtable Redefinition of Business Purpose May Create Incentive Problems* 
How can “stakeholder” interests be incorporated into incentive plans?
How is the trade-off between a shareholder and a stakeholder measured?
If companies find that serving some “stakeholders” e.g. environmentalists increases shareholder value how does that differ from current policy?
How will many shareholders react to reducing their primacy?
