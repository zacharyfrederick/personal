# The Economics of Business
# Overview of U.S. Firm Demographics
In 2015 there were 5.9 million firms and 7.7 million establishments in the U.S. https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/econ/susb/susb-historical.html 
This population of firms is very complex and dynamic
The succeeding graphics give you a taste of the demographics

# Steven Klepper’s earlier work: “Entry, Exit, Growth and Innovation over the Product Life Cycle”
Explains the emergence of a dominant design
Number of entrants often rises at the beginning of an industry but declines over time until number of entrants becomes small or zero
Number of producers increases initially, reaches a peak, then declines despite continued industry growth
Rate of change of the market shares of the largest firms declines eventually and the industry structure stabilizes
The diversity of competing product variations and the number of significant product innovations tend to reach a peak during the period of growth in number of producers, then decline
Over time, producers devote increasing effort to process relative to product innovation
While the number of producers is growing, the most recent entrants account for a disproportionate share of product innovations

Evolutionary approach to industry structure
Builds on earlier 1996 work and others
Driven by R&D which is undertaken to lower unit costs
R&D to lower unit costs rewards larger firm
The average cost for firm i in period t is:
cit = ct – aig(rit) + εi
- ct is a base cost common to all firms
- ai denotes the firm’s R&D productivity
-  rit is firm i’s R&D spending in period t  
-  g(rit) is function determining reduction in average cost from R&D 
- εit ≥ 0 represents a one period cost shock  
	-                
# The Model continued
Firms are distinguished by the productivity of their R&D* 
There are two levels: a1 and a2. 
	- Experienced firms and some exceptional inexperienced firms are classified as a1 
	- All other firms are a2.  
	- Experience is defined largely as previous operation in related fields. 
*Arnold Kling makes an interesting observation about the value of experience in technology firms: http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/the-source-of-entry-barriers-on-the-internet/ 
# The Model continued…
The R&D function is subject to diminishing returns: 
g’(rit) >0 this positive first derivative indicates that spending on R&D has a positive effect on unit costs. 
g’’(rit) < 0 this negative second derivatives indicates the effect on unit cost diminishes as R%D increases. 
After choosing R&D budgets and m expenditure firms are subject to a random cost shock
# Model, continued
Expected profit determines entry and exit decision
∏it = [pt – ct + ai g(rit)]Qit – rit – m(∆Qit ; Qit-1) 
-            Where ∏it is the expected profit for firm i in period t
Firms enter or remain if expected ∏it > 0, exit if ∏it < 0 and are indifferent if ∏it = 0
Firms also exit if εit  > pt – ct + ai g(rit) which means the shock would be greater than the firm’s margin
- This is called a random exit
Firms exit also if ∏it < 0 which means the firm cannot operate profitably even at its most efficient level
- This is called a competitive exit
# Model continued
Differentiating Equation 1 with respect to rit.t and Qit
[2] 			aig’(rit)Qit -1 = 0 
Re-arranging [2] we get aig’(rit) =1 where aig’(rit) is the marginal return to R&D and 1 is the marginal cost. 
[3]	 pt – ct + ai g(rit) – m’(∆Qit ; Qit-1) = 0 
Re-arrange [3] to get pt – ct + ai g(rit) = m’(∆Qit ;Qit-1) indicating that firms will invest in m until the marginal cost of a unit of growth equals the marginal profit per unit of output. 
# Hypotheses derived from the model
Hypothesis 1. In the early-entry cohorts, at young ages the hazard of the experienced entrants will be less than the hazard of the inexperienced entrants, but the hazards of the two groups will converge with age. In contrast, in the later-entry cohorts the hazards of the experienced and inexperienced will be the same.
Hypothesis 2. The earlier the time of entry, the lower the hazard of experienced firms at every age, whereas for inexperienced firms earlier entrants will unequivocally have a lower hazard only at older ages.  
Hypothesis 3. Among all firms, earlier entrants will have a lower hazard at every age if early entrants are predominately experienced firms; otherwise they will have unequivocally lower hazard only at older ages.

# Automobile Cohort Survival Curves 
# Automobile Cohort Survival 
220 firms in the 1895-1904 cohort 
- Initial rapid exit rate but stabilized at around 5%
- All of the “Big Three” that formed the oligopoly were from the first cohort
 323 firms in the 1905-1911 cohort
- Much more rapid attrition than the first cohort
- All were gone within about 45 years
185 firms in the 1912-1966 cohort
- Very sharp hazard curve
- Last member lasted around 20 years
# Tire Company Cohort Survival
# Tire Company Cohort Survival 
First cohort 1905-1906 comprised 23 firms
- About 68 percent expired within 30 years but remaining firms enjoyed relatively long runs
- The four dominant players established their oligopoly pretty quickly
- Goodyear, Goodrich, Firestone and U.S. Rubber held 53.3 percent in 1926 rising quickly to 72.1 in 1933 
The second (1907-1917) cohort of 216 firms loses about 90 percent of its members in the first 30 years 
	- then less than another 8 percent in the next 30 years before leveling off at around 3.2 percent by year 60
The third (1918-1929) cohort declines more rapidly than the first or second, 
- loses about 95 percent of the 313 members within 20 years. 
The fourth (1930-1980) cohort is something of an anomaly 
- violates the hypothesis that the hazard rates diverge with date of entry.
-  The first 40 years saw about 95% of the 74 firms exiting, tracking closely with the rate of the second cohort. 
# Television Company Cohort Survival 
# Television Company Cohort Survival 
Cohort entry dates are fairly close
Survival curve divergence is nearly as predicted but the untimely demise of cohort 1 violates the hypothesis
Second cohort 1948-1949 fell at a faster rate than cohort 1 but soldiered on after demise of cohort 1
Third (1950-1989) cohort eroded more quickly than the others and was gone in about 26 years. 
# Penicillin Company Cohort Survival 
# Penicillin Company Cohort Survival 
Atypical case due to WWII production program involving 20 companies, 16 of which entered in the first cohort
30 percent of cohort 1 survived for about 50 years
Bristol, Wyeth, Pfizer and Lilly – all of them veterans of the war effort survived to form an oligopoly. 
# Conclusions
All four of the subject industries experienced shake-outs and evolved into oligopolies made up of early entrants with experience
The predicted inverse relationship between date of entry and cohort survival rates held in almost all instances
Support for the theory that experience and early entry are major factors in survival 
Indirect support for the notion of entrepreneurial judgment under uncertainty. Experience often improves judgment.
