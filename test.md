# Part I: Introducing Economics of Business 
Economics, the Delightful Science (our framework)	- The beneficial power of self-interest
	- The division of labor (specialization) is a primary source of a society’s wealth
	- The importance of freedom to trade
	- A dynamic self-directed system exhibiting spontaneous order
A Very Brief History of Trade and BusinessBusiness and GovernmentPositive vs. Normative Economics# The Pillars of the Course
Adam Smith; foundations discussed in Wealth of Nations (1776) include but are not limited to:	- The beneficial power of self-interest
	- The division of labor, or specialization, is a primary basis of a nation’s wealth
	- The importance of freedom to trade among people, businesses, and nations
	- The market as a dynamic system that exhibits spontaneous order
# The Beneficial Power of Self-interest
“It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.” Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations, p.14 The measure of an economy is how well it serves the interests of consumers, not producers. This is referred to as consumer sovereignty Businesses survive and prosper to the extent that they meet the demands of their customers efficiently# The Beneficial Power of Self-interest……
Self-interest ≠ greed, avarice, etc. although some people are greedy and venalAdam Smith acknowledged man’s interest in the welfare and happiness of others:		- “How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.”*
		- Our senses of virtue and justice emerge from our social nature
Rational Choice Theory – a methodology	- People have complete, consistent and transitive preferences
	- People take account of information available, anticipated or forecast events, and probabilities
	- People make the choice they feel maximizes their welfare or utility 
	- People’s choices may be constrained by cognitive ability, income, time or other factors
* Adam Smith, 1859, The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Eamon Butler’s excellent synopsis is at https://www.adamsmith.org/the-theory-of-moral-sentiments *Adam Smith, opening lines of The Theory of Moral Sentiments.# 
Pursuit of self-interest requires some degree of rationality	- Perfect rationality vs. bounded rationality 
	- Experimental and behavioral economics explore human decision making
	- People have complex preference functions which determine the effectiveness of  incentive systems
# The Beneficial Power of Self-interest…
How do people evaluate the level of self-interest?Utility; an introspective measure of value and guide to self-interest 	- Reflects early psychology and utilitarianism
	- Initially only a consumer attribute
	- Utility extended to production through managers’ behavior and decision-making
	- Subjective, ordinal measure 
	- Economists have tried to minimize the psychological factors but not entirely successful 
# The Beneficial Power of Self-interest…
Pursuit of self-interest must involve some degree of rationality to explain consumer choice and sovereignty	- Early utility theory reflected hedonistic philosophy/psychology
	- Cardinal utility, Bentham, et al measurable degrees of utility (“utils”); pleasure and pain (Edgeworth’s hedonimeter)
	- Ordinal utility, doubts about measurement, eventual realization it was unnecessary
	- Marginal utility credited to Stanley Jevons, Leon Walras, and Carl Menger. J. B. Clark and Alfred Marshall expanded 
	- Slutsky, 1915 effort to disengage entirely from hedonistic psychology (not completely successful)
	- Samuelson, 1938, advances “purely behavioral” revealed preference 
	- Houthakker demonstrated that revealed preference was consistent with ordinal utility
# The Beneficial Power of Self-interest…
Neoclassical utility is now as Armen Alchian said:			- “…For analytical convenience it is customary to postulate that an individual seeks to maximize something subject to some constraints. The thing -or numerical measure of the "thing"- which he seeks to maximize is called "utility". Whether or not utility is of some kind glow or warmth, or happiness, is here   irrelevant; …”
# The division of labor or specialization: a primary source of society’s wealth
A fundamental and powerful insight	- Observation of extraordinary productivity of pin-makers
	- Specialization calls for trade – “can’t eat pins”
Societies can be measured in terms of division of labor	- Anthropologists use to evaluate civilizations
	- Cooperation and hence division of labor within large bands of humans probably originated in later Pleistocene (old stone age)
		- Remarkable cultural and genetic evolutionary feat 
	- Neanderthals were probably generalists with relatively limited spans of cooperation, Cro-Magnons seem to have embraced division of labor and cooperation more fully
	- Ancient Greeks recognized value of occupational specialty if not the reasons
The organization of firms, communities, and governments can be examined in light of the extent of the division of labor # The division of labor or specialization: primary source of society’s wealth…
The division of labor is limited by the extent of the market	- The more extensive the opportunities for trade, the more intensive will be the division of labor among people
	- Smith saw trade as an opportunity to increase market size and therefore stimulate more division of labor and thus more output and wealth
Some industries go through a life cycle of generalist-specialist-generalist	- Stigler 1951 article in week 2
# The division of labor or specialization: primary source of society’s wealth…
Specialization gives rise to complexity and the need for organization	- At some point, the option of organizing production through firms instead of the market emerges
		- Using the market involves costs
		- Hierarchy may be more efficient in many cases 
	- Productivity for any given level of technical capability is largely a function of specialization and the quality of organization supporting the specialists
	- Technical progress depends in large part upon the ability to capture the economic gains from a new technology or process
	- Capital and investment in physical assets such as tools stimulates specialization
	- The degree of specialization of capital assets (called asset specificity) is an important factor in determining the boundaries of firms
# The division of labor or specialization: a primary source of society’s wealth…
Extensive/intensive relationship holds within firms; ceteris paribus, larger firms employ more specialistsSpecialization is seen in products as well, segmentation, customization, multi-attribute goodsWords you’ll see that are variants on specialization; idiosyncrasy, asset-specific, transaction-specific… # The division of labor or specialization: a primary source of society’s wealth…
Some see specialization, especially mechanization as evil:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n9ESFJTnHs Industrialization fostered by specializationKnight’s list of gains from organized activity:			- Utilization of natural aptitudes; especially leaders and followers
			- Development and utilization of acquired skill and knowledge
			- Changing the piece of work is cheaper, within limits, than changing the activity performed on the work
			- Natural advantages in the case of “natural” resources
			- Artificial specialization of material agents (tools and machines)
			- Minor technical gains
Excessive focus on granularity of factory and assembly line divisions of labor makes it easy to overlook the tremendous strides in science, technology, medicine, etc. through specialization# The division of labor or specialization: a primary source of society’s wealth…
Second industrial revolution of late 1800s stimulated development of management science			- Substantially larger, more complex organizations
				- -> Need to better coordinate resources
			- Standard Oil and others pioneered many modern management practices
			- Alfred Chandler notes the emergence of the modern firm
Frederick Taylor and “scientific management” sought optimal degree of specialization			- Modern process reengineering descended from Taylor via Michael Hammer to focus on process and application of information technology
			- Frederick Taylor claimed he was a friend of workers but thought many of them dumber than an ox
# The Importance of Freedom to Trade
Benefits of specialization are realized through tradeTrade is the voluntary exchange of goods for mutual benefit (a form of cooperative behavior)Adam Smith believed that man’s propensity to trade was innate and uniqueTrade should be protected from rent-seeking and crony capitalism through subsidy and tariffs Trade benefits from and stimulates development of financial institutions and systemsCurrency benefits trade but is vulnerable to manipulation# The Importance of Freedom to Trade
Trade promotes wealth by directing resources to most efficient usesTrade helps liberate people to do what they do best or enjoyTrade reflects comparative advantage which provides an opportunity and role for all partiesTrade expands markets and thus extends opportunities for specialization and wealth creation Trade involves risks and stimulates the development of financial instruments	- Insurance, risk management arrangements
	- Investment and lending against future prospects
	- Equity arrangements 
# The Importance of Freedom to Trade…
Laissez faire – “let it be” or  “leave alone” 		- Not used by Smith, nor equivalent to the Invisible Hand
		- Initially a form of economic liberalism (original meaning)
			- Now used derogatorily by many 
			- Originated in context of oppressive state meddling and mercantile policies
			- Established in English thought during debate on Corn Laws
			- Embraced by libertarians
# A Dynamic System Exhibiting Spontaneous Order
Spontaneous order is the most profound insight of economics and the most difficult for many people to understand and appreciateIn most cases, the market directs scarce resources efficiently“Invisible Hand” of Adam Smith similar notion Central planners are simply incapable of knowing the relative and absolute preferences of consumers and producers’ costs of goods and services (Hayek’s “Fatal Conceit”)# Beware of Perfect Strawmen
Markets are not ‘perfect’ nor do economists naively believe they are	- Rules, laws, customs may distort operation
	- Market power may be acquired politically or criminally and abused
	- Asymmetric information may undermine market transactions
	- Social costs may not equal private (e.g. “externalities” which we discuss in the Coase article on Social Costs)
	- Initial conditions may be inequitable and difficult to remedy
Beware of “curing” every perceived market failure with government mandates	- Entrepreneurs often find opportunity in market failures and initiate a solution
	- Government “solutions” tend to inhibit the natural operation of the market
	- Well-intentioned government regulatory efforts are often captured by special interests and then serve as barriers to free trade and competition
	- Planners cannot possibly acquire and apply the information produced and conveyed by markets
	- Elinor Ostrom won Nobel for pointing out the many successful voluntary institutions formed to deal with difficult economic situations
	-  
# Spontaneous Order…
According to James Buchanan “discovery” of spontaneous order was the greatest achievement of the Scottish Enlightenment (Smith, Hume, Ferguson, et al)Mandeville (not Scottish) set out the basic ideas in his classic The Fable of the Bees or Private Vices, Publick Benefits					- Vast Numbers throng'd the fruitful Hive;Yet those vast Numbers made 'em thrive;Millions endeavouring to supplyEach other's Lust and Vanity. 
Adam Ferguson expressed the classic formulation					- Every step and every movement of the multitude even in what are termed enlightened ages, are made with equal blindness to the future; and nations stumble upon establishments, which are indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design 
Adam Smith, used the term “Invisible Hand” to describe the unintended public benefits of private actions     # Spontaneous Order…
F.A. Hayek, coined the term “spontaneous order”Vernon Smith noted that the fundamental division in economics is between constructivist and ecological rationality		- “Constructivist rationality, applied to individuals or organizations, involves the deliberate use of reason to analyze and prescribe actions judged to better than alternative feasible actions that might be chosen.”… “Ecological rationality refers to emergent order in the form of the practices, norms, and evolving institutional rules governing action by individuals that are created by human interactions, but not by conscious human design. “
Spontaneous order and evolutionary change is observed in many complex systems including law, language, culture, technology, religion, etc. Much political dispute is between those who accept spontaneous order or “bottom up” economic evolution and those who insist on managed, top down economies # Spontaneous Order…
Markets evolve as a consequence of man’s actions but not his intent Market results are an evolutionary “bottom up” phenomenon opposed to “top down” statist approachMalthusian selection and competition influenced both Darwin and Russell, other disciplinesWe’ll introduce evolutionary economics in Alchian’s1950 article	- Significance of selection pressures versus behavior; adoption versus adaption 
	- Uncertainty and random events versus intentions and motives
Stigler provided a cost-based evolutionary model of the industrial life cycleIn Nelson and Winter and in Klepper we discuss how the evolutionary dynamic is expressed in product and industry life cycles# Spontaneous Order…

Hunter gatherers, mostly generalists, not much trade. 	- Largely egalitarian community; sharing was an important and probably evolutionary advantage in world without much food storage (similar to blood sharing among Vampire bats)

Industrial Revolution various dating; mid/late 18th century to mid 19th century, tremendous increases in productivity achieved in large part by the application of steam power to ships, trains, factoriesThe proximate “cause” and location of the IR is still debated; David Landes pointed to culture, others to the synthesis of empire as source of inputs and market for outputs, others to political stability of UK, etc.More recently Deirdre McCloskey places the origins in the Netherlands and ascribes the adoption and respect for bourgeoisie values as the enabling forceBusiness historian Alfred Chandler saw another, late 19th century revolution driven by the “network” technologies such as rail and telegraph enabling larger, more coordinated firms Some think that information and communication technologies, especially the Internet, are stimulating another industrial/commercial revolution Others such a Northwestern’s Robert Gordon argue that information technology has not had as profound an effect on the economy as earlier, more fundamental technologies # GDP per capita in England since 1270* 
# The Supreme Myths of the Industrial Revolution 
Hayek deplored, “… the legend of the deterioration of the position of the working classes in consequence of the rise of ‘capitalism’ ….”John Clapham’s extensive study of statistics and contemporary accounts revealed steady progress and improvementDurkheim credited the IR with expanding and enhancing culture but was very ambivalent about the stresses of modern economyMisleading stories were told by Dickens, Marx, Engels, Hobsbawm, K. Polanyi, and othersRomanticism, Rousseau-ism, etc. still attractive to many# The Supreme Myths of the Industrial Revolution 
Cultural, political, social reaction to industrial revolution		- Popular but exaggerated vision of satanic mills, child labor and abuse but little context and examination of opportunity costs
		- Destruction of semi-mythical pastoral life
		- Stimulated Marxism and socialism
		- Fostered class divisions in Great Britain
# Second Industrial Revolution ?
Alfred Chandler saw late 1800s as a second IRBrought about by network technologies e.g. telegraph, telephone, railroadEnlarged markets supported scale, fostered specializationCalled for more systematic approach to managementBirth of “scientific management,” e.g. Frederick TaylorModern business firm evolvedEconomists’ classic view of the firm as a black box of production functions no longer adequate# Business and Government 
Increasing debate about the role of firms v.v. “stakeholders” and “shareholders” Business Roundtable endorsed “stakeholder” focus in 2019. Democrat presidential  candidates endorsed the end of shareholder capitalismGovernment affects business on three levels	- Rules and legal environment – very important
	- Government firms, e.g. USPS and government backed firms e.g. Fannie Mae, compete with private firms often “unfairly”
	- Regulation and taxation; some worthwhile, some  incubate crony capitalism
Private and social costs may diverge (Coase 1961)Occupational licensing is often barrier to entry and often closes off opportunity for the least advantagedUnintended and inadvertent consequences are common in government actionPublic Choice Theory examines politicians and bureaucrats in terms of people maximizing their own gains or utility – much more effective framework than the Public Interest theory of selfless public servants advancing the public good# Positive Versus Normative Economics 
Positive economics: objective science looking at the way the real economy works, seeks to develop models and make predictionsNormative economics, policy advice and advocacy, perhaps based on positive economicsPositive economics always looks at real opportunity costsAlways apply Bastiat’s guidance on the “seen” and “unseen”Some believe economics cannot be an entirely positive science# Business and Government

Economics takes broad social field for its domainEconomics itself is subject to division of labor or specializationHomo economicus was a simplification to make basic analysis tractable Recent work in behavioral economics, hybrid of psychology and economics, providing some insights but often reinvents the wheel# Part II. Ronald Coase and The Nature of the Firm
Where do firms come from?	- Before Coase, the classical firm 
		- Comprised a set of production cost functions, 
		- Operated by entrepreneur with hyper-rational knowledge and skill
Sir Dennis Robertson noticed an anomaly:	- “… islands of conscious power in this ocean of unconscious co-operation like lumps of butter coagulating in a pail of buttermilk.”
# The Emergence of Firms
Coase’s fundamental insight; there are costs to using the market	- Determining prices
	- Contracting and re-contracting 
	- Variety of transactions costs
Coase proclaimed the distinguishing characteristic of the firm to be suppression of the price mechanism and substitution of hierarchyIn Coase’s world, the fundamental question facing a firm is “make or buy” – the issue of vertical integration# Coase’s Firm and Its Limits
Firm; an entity that conducts transactions internally through hierarchy more efficiently than can be achieved externally through market	- Coase didn’t address issue of ongoing comparative efficiency
	- Hirshleifer (1956) worked out relationship between transfer pricing and market price demonstrating that firms can’t completely suppress the pricing system
# Coase and Knight
Coase mentions and then harshly rejects Frank Knight’s notion that firms emerge when the entrepreneur, one who makes judgmental decisions under uncertainty, engages people who accept direction in return for assured compensation.Some economists have re-examined the Knightian model of firms and it is making a bit of a comeback.The Coasian and Knightian models may not be mutually exclusive. 	- Someone (the entrepreneur) has to see the opportunity to exploit the market’s comparative advantage
# Coase’s Firm and Its Limits
Limits to firm scale and scope set by diminishing returns to management (sometimes called entrepreneurial capacity)	- Point where cost of additional activity plus transaction costs just equals cost of working through market or another firm
“Other things being equal, therefore, a firm will tend to be larger:	- The less the costs of organizing and the slower these costs rise with an increase in the transactions organized.
	- The less likely the entrepreneur is to make mistakes and the smaller the increase in mistakes with an increase in the transactions organized.
	- The greater the lowering (or the less the rise) in the supply price of factors of production to firms of larger size”
# Coase’s Firm and Its Limits…
Coase acknowledges but does not develop possibility that small firms might have some advantages Technology often, but not always, favors larger firms (recall Chandler) 	- Technologies that reduce the:
			- Cost of spatial separation favor large
			- Cost of management (metering) favor large
Some technologies favor market over internal transactions
