# The Economics of Business
# Graduate Student Requirement
The school requires that graduate students perform some task, project, or satanic ritual to distinguish them from undergraduates and non-credit students
In the past we have tried team projects, papers, etc. 
The timing of the project has to be late enough that you have some basis for performing it 
In the past we scheduled the project as a 2d-half effort due a couple weeks before the final
The large class size and experience argues against papers
Team projects have mixed results, some good, a lot of shirking
We have developed a “treasure hunt” involving identifying people, terms, and concepts and plan to employ that this term
# Class 2 Quiz review
1.What are the key economic problems or issues that Alchian and Demsetz address in “Production, Information Costs, and Economic Organization”? 
- The theory of economic organization i.e. are gains from specialization and cooperative production best captured within a firm or across markets?
- What economic factors determine the structure of the organization?
- None of the above
- Both a and b
-  
2.What factor(s) give rise to the metering problem within economic organizations?
- The difficulty of measuring individual productivity in a team production setting
- People’s multi-attribute utility functions including desire for pay and for leisure, leading to potential for shirking
- The asymmetric information positions of agents v.v. principals
- Positive metering costs
- All of the above: a, b, c, d
- a and b 
3.Team production involves:
- Joint non-separable production functions
- Several types of resources
- Output that is not the sum of separable outputs
- The resources used belong to more than one person
- All of the above
# Class 2 Quiz review
4. How do firms typically most effectively address the metering and monitoring problem?
- Appointment of specialists (e.g. managers) to direct, observe and monitor the employees (agents) 
- Offer employees (agents) rewards for reporting shirking of other employees
- Hire only principled and honest employees 
5. How are monitors (team managers) often incentivized to not shirk their monitoring role?
- Additional layers of management to monitor the subordinate monitors
- A claim on the residual produced by the team
 
6. What particular characteristic of firms do Alchian and Demsetz use to characterize the various types of firms?
- The type of ownership, e.g. public, private, etc.
- The intensity by which the firms incentivize managers to create residual value
- The degree to which they make rather than buy key elements of their value chain
# Class 2 Quiz review
7.In “The Division of Labor is Limited by the Extent of the Market,” George Stigler was addressing what major historical economic issue?
- Fear of unchecked increasing returns to scale. If division of labor increased with market size, one would expect monopolies in many industries as one firm could achieve lower costs by expanding and capturing more and more of the market and hence, opportunities for specialization
- How does the degree of specialization within a firm change over its life cycle?
- Both of the above
 
8.Which “shape” production functions are likely to be the first “outsourced” i.e. supplied by an outside producer?
- The “U” shaped cost curves in which unit costs first decline and then increase
- The continually increasing cost curves in which unit costs rise throughout the relevant range
- The continually decreasing cost curves in which unit costs decline over a broad range greater than a single firm output
- None of the above
 
9.What reason(s) is (are) given by Stigler for why there were so many vertical mergers and acquisitions during WWII?
- Price controls kept intermediate product prices below market clearing levels, causing a supply shortage relative to demand 
- Acquiring companies could adjust output of the now “internal” production to meet needs and stay below the radar of price controllers
- Both of the above
- None of the above 
# Class 2 Quiz review
10.Adam Smith’s theorem and Stigler’s amplification about the relationship of market size and the extent of specialization helps to explain which observed phenomenon?
- Why undeveloped small countries often fail to benefit from the adoption of the advanced technology of countries such as Germany or the U.S.
- Localization as a method of increasing the economic size of an industry and benefitting from specialization
- The typically smaller sizes of plants in localized, large production centers
- The emergence of hubs or clusters such as Silicon Valley

# Sir Peter Medawar, Nobel Laureate
Sir Peter was an acerbic fellow much admired by Richard Dawkins and your instructor. On of my favorites: 
“The alternative to thinking in evolutionary terms is not to think at all.” 
# 
Marshall, “The Mecca of the economist lies in economic biology rather than in economic dynamics.” 
Tension between Darwinian and Newtonian systems perspective (analogous to “ecological” vs. “constructivist”)
Recent work, e.g. Robert Plomin, Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are suggests that DNA is a much greater influence than nurture
Management hubris e.g., “inventing the future”
Collins et al implicit notion of super manager and 
   super firm

# In Search of Superfirm
Collins et al employ an exemplary firm process based on sorting databases for high performers
Statistical flaw of “selecting for the dependent variable”
- Leads to a very truncated distribution; no basis for evaluating the larger population
- Not scientific
	- Does not test a hypothesis
	- Does not examine range of variables, e.g. as in regression
	- No dynamic model, no “if-then” capacity
# Uncertainty and Survival
Firms seek to survive and prosper in an uncertain world
Knight’s distinction between measurable risk and unmeasurable uncertainty is important in this context
We cannot see the future but must still make decisions
Uncertainty necessary for existence of economic profit* (There is no need for or possibility of economic profit if people can see the future.)
Entrepreneur makes decisions under uncertainty and reaps the rewards or losses  (e.g. pays factors at current value, receives future value)
This insight goes at least as far back as Richard Cantillon in 18th century but is still overlooked regularly 
- * Profit or residual over and above the opportunity cost of capital necessary to attract it to the endeavor
# Uncertainty and Survival
Eventually limits of survival are reached (no firm lasts forever but some hang on for a very long time)
- Entrepreneurial capacity is the ultimate fixed factor
- Environment moves in unanticipated manner
- Prior successful adaptations may inhibit reaction to new forces
- Others may be found “more” fit and selected or adopted by the environment or market
- Entrepreneurs find opportunity in new products, processes and stimulate a bit of “creative destruction”
- Cognitive capacity is overwhelmed, mistakes are made, holes are opened up
# Limits to Scale
Even Marxist evolutionary geneticists recognize that size and complexity eventually limit the size of institutions and organisms.
J.B.S. Haldane, in a 1928 article, “On Being the Right Size”* discussed the optimal sizes of various types of animals and then extended the principles to institutions:
-       “To the biologist the problem of socialism appears largely as a problem of size. The extreme socialists desire to run every nation as a single business concern. I do not suppose that Henry Ford would find much difficulty in running Andorra or Luxembourg on a socialistic basis. He has already more men on his pay-roll than their population. It is conceivable that a syndicate of Fords, if we could find them, would make Belgium Ltd or Denmark Inc. pay their way. But while nationalization of certain industries is an obvious possibility in the largest of states, I find it no easier to picture a completely socialized British Empire or United States than an elephant turning somersaults or a  hippopotamus jumping a hedge.”  
- * A copy is at http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html 
# The Meaning of Pure or Economic Profit*
   “First of all, we have to make it clear what we mean by ‘pure profits’. However confused in their terminology, economists since the days of Adam Smith have always meant to exclude all necessary cost outlays from the definition of pure profit. Pure profit is a return over and above the opportunity cost payments, the payments necessary to draw forth productive services from their most remunerative alternative employment. At the same time pure profit is also a return in excess of ‘real costs’ since it is not required to maintain any productive agent in existence.” … Mark Blaug, Economic Theory in Retrospect, p458 (emphasis added)
    *I generally consider “economic” and “pure” profit synonyms but different authors favor one or the other and some students are familiar with one but not the other term. Neither should be confused with accounting profit.
# Models and Judgment
Models are a way to capture and apply knowledge and experience 
- May be informal (pattern recognition) or formal (mathematical)
- Judgment, institutional knowledge, etc. may comprise informal models
- Seek to reduce the degree of uncertainty 
- If system modeled is completely deterministic (“if-then” or constructivist), quality of prediction depends on knowledge of initial conditions and the continuity of system characteristics. E.g. Classical physics as expressed by LaPlace and his demon
- But models also create an intellectual feedback loop and influence our view of the world.
	- Most applied models used in decision making under uncertainty implicitly assume way too much certainty and a strict notion of equilibrium  
- Perhaps the greatest divergence between the “Austrian” school of economics and the predominant neoclassical view is over the notion and significance of a tendency to equilibrium
# Achieving Equilibriums vs. Tendencies
Simple physical systems tend to reach equilibrium quickly
Complex physical systems may take a long time, e.g. the expansion of the universe. But, so far as we know, it will get to some sort of cold death equilibrium one day or maybe not
Economy often conceived as a quickly equilibrating system that is normally in equilibrium until disturbed whereupon it quickly finds a new equilibrium as illustrated in comparative statics
Austrian school didn’t accept the notion of a normal state of  equilibrium and argued that there was only a tendency toward equilibrium
Evolutionary economics views the economy, ceteris paribus, as having a tendency to equilibrium
# Forms of Rationality: Constructivist and Ecological
“Constructivist rationality, applied to individuals or organizations, involves the deliberate use of reason to analyze and prescribe actions judged to be better than alternative feasible actions that might be chosen.”… “Ecological rationality refers to emergent order in the form of the practices, norms, and evolving institutional rules governing action by individuals that are created by human interactions, but not by conscious human design.” 
Vernon L. Smith, 2008, Rationality in Economics: Constructivist and Ecological Forms, Cambridge University Press, New York, p2
# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory”
Alchian sets out an evolutionary approach to
describing firm behavior:
Embodies principles of biological evolution and natural selection (recall Marshall)
Economic system is an adoptive mechanism that selects from a variety of “exploratory” actions generated by adaptive pursuit of profits or success
Alchian establishes his notion of environmental adoption and then combines it with a notion of behavior under uncertainty and incomplete information
Under these conditions, people engage in adaptive, trial and error, imitative, and innovative behaviors
This contrasts starkly with the typical picture of foresight and perfect rationality often ascribed to economic actors and implicit in many forecasting models
# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory” continued
“Profit Maximization” Not a Guide to Action
Under Uncertainty:
Economic decisions are often modeled as being undertaken by highly rational creatures with perfect foresight seeking optimum outcomes
Gerhard Tintner, a pioneering econometrician, argued that under uncertainty, the objective, literal pursuit of “profit maximization” is meaningless
Without perfect foresight, i.e. certainty, there is no basis for literal profit maximization as a guide to behavior (of course with perfect foresight there is no need for “profit”)
# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory” continued
Without perfect foresight, i.e. certainty, there is no basis for profit maximization as a guide to behavior*
Unless you can determine the profit maximizing route, you can’t pursue it in a rational manner
Without uncertainty there is no role for profit
The market can price risk but not uncertainty
*even this representation may be confusing since it may suggest that there are two known distributions. 
# Uncertainty and Economic Thought
Alchian and Tinbergen’s notion of the inability to make deterministic decisions in a world of uncertainty applies generally to the notion of what economics is
Nobel Laureate James Buchanan, noted for his work in public choice theory, expressed the implications for economic theory and practice
- “The principle that exposure to economics should convey is that of the spontaneous coordination which the market achieves.  The central principle of economics is not the economizing process; it is not the maximization of objective functions subject to constraints.  Once we become methodologically trapped in the maximization paradigm, economics becomes mathematics or engineering.”*
# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory” continued
Frank Knight’s famous distinction between
risk and uncertainty is relevant to Alchian’s point
Risk; known potential and measurable outcomes and probabilities
Uncertainty; unknown outcomes and probabilities
- Judgment; the phenomena that processes uncertainty into basis for action (probably related to entrepreneurial capacity, maybe to “animal spirits”)
- People differ wrt to judgmental capability
- Some specialize in offering and providing judgment, when they direct others, they become entrepreneurs
# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory”  (an aside)
	- Complexity theory provides perspective on flawed foresight:
	- The study of complex dynamical systems, aka “science of surprise”
	- Insight into why we are “surprised” 
	- Models often fail us in depicting reality especially in the presence of uncertainty
	- Hayek linked spontaneous order to complexity theory
	- Economy is simply too complex to be managed piece by piece by authorities
		- See long list of failures from USSR to Venezuela*
		- *Socialist romanticists often excuse failure by saying real socialism has never been tried. This is largely irrelevant because central planning has been tried often and always fails.
# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory” resumes
“Success Is Based On Results, Not Motivation”
Realized profits (not maximum except by chance) are the mark of success and ticket to continue playing
It doesn’t matter how they came about, their existence is sufficient to continue playing
Success reflects relative superiority, doesn’t require motivation, and may simply reflect luck
The environment or market selects (adopts) from among the variety offered on the basis of fitness
# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory” continued
“Chance Or Luck Is One Method Of Achieving Success”
Conscious decision making is not necessary to explain success in a selective and adoptive environment
If a success factor is randomly acquired, e.g. an unplanned trip route that happens to be the only one to include gas stations, the selection’s success is valid and can be explained  (difference between explaining and predicting)
Chance can explain many exceptional people and firms see Paul Krugman, “There will always be a Soros,” Fortune, 3-30-98

# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory” continued
“Chance Does Not Imply Nondirected, Random Allocation Of Resources”
Borel’s illustration of the surprising persistence of some random games precludes uncritically ascribing longevity to foresight and rationality
Random horse race bettors will produce ex post set of perfect “forecasts”
A set of people acting with some foresight and motivation may not be distinguishable from a group of random actors
# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory” continued
A chance-dominated model does not preclude
prediction, explanation, or diagnoses:
Realized requisites for survival under alternative conditions permit statements about likely results under various situations
Economists, like everyone else, have 20-20 hindsight and can use their tools to explain past outcomes
It is not necessary that any particular firm change its behavior but only that the set of firms selected for the next round behave in a manner “fit” for the environment
Questionnaire methods are often invalid tests of marginalist conditions. 
# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory” continued
“Individual Adapting Via Imitation And Trial and Error”
Firms will imitate successful behaviors; imitation of successful actions is a justifiable reaction. Adopting standard or orthodox rules of behavior, especially those of winners makes sense when:
- There may be no obvious criterion for the decision-making
- Environmental variability may discourage new models 
- The problem may be very complicated
- Uncertainty may make the problem intractable
- Superiority to rivals is crucial
- There may be no practicable trial-and-error mechanism
# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory” continued
Imitation is a way to avoid making decisions and being accountable for poor results (“No one was ever fired for buying IBM” –old aphorism)
Much of the passion for “benchmarking” and “world-class practices” is based on avoiding a painful and risky analysis or test of options.
Much of innovation is accounted for by imperfect or flawed imitation resulting in unintended innovation (analogous to new characteristics emerging from DNA copying errors)
# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory” continued
In addition to imitation, trial-and-error is a conscious form of adaptive behavior under uncertainty
Trial-and-error does not guarantee an eventual optimum will be reached
The near-sighted grasshopper may find a local maximum but not see the distant global maximum
Trial-and-error may work when the function is continually rising, without dips, to the optimum
# Armen A. Alchian, “Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory” continued
“The economic counterparts of genetic heredity, mutations, and natural selection are imitation, innovation, and positive profits”
# Richard R. Nelson, Sidney G. Winter, “Evolutionary Theorizing in Economics”
Earlier interest in dynamics, disequilibrium, and trial-and-error searches for profitable positions was displaced by the notion of highly rational searches for optimum solutions
Interest revived with increasing importance of industries subject to technological disruption
Schumpeterian notions of continual disequilibrium, learning and creative destruction revived interest
# Richard R. Nelson, Sidney G. Winter, “Evolutionary Theorizing in Economics”…
Nelson and Winter describe four characteristics of dynamic economic systems
Variety refers to the number of different approaches or models present at various rounds and subject to selection
Behavioral continuity is necessary to give selection validity. 
Profit induced growth is necessary to equip the winners in one round with additional resources to contest the next
Limited path dependence rules out a powerful feed-back mechanism from quickly eliminating all but one player 
# Richard R. Nelson, Sidney G. Winter, “Evolutionary Theorizing in Economics”…
In their section on competence, learning and routines, Nelson and Winter address what they call the “competence puzzle” 
Dichotomy between competence exhibited in routinized actions and poor performance in novel situations or cases where complex logical analysis is called for
Competency can be acquired by learning and training involving short term feed back
Complex and effective behavior is routinized behavior
Routines persist in part because they economize on learning costs and reduce frictions caused by unanticipated experimentation or novel behavior 
The heart of the development puzzle is how incredibly complex technologies, systems, and organizations emerge – they evolve in incremental steps
# Richard R. Nelson, Sidney G. Winter, “Evolutionary Theorizing in Economics”…
Nelson and Wilson argue that evolutionary
approaches are more concerned with consistency
with current science of learning:
Once learned, routines or skills are difficult to adjust quickly (game example)
Persistence of routines and ‘inherited strategies’ can and often does inhibit adaptive behavior (e.g. Polaroid)
# Richard R. Nelson, Sidney G. Winter, “Evolutionary Theorizing in Economics”…
The conundrum of routines is that they reflect and preserve the successful adaptations made by a firm over time and economize on learning but they may introduce rigidity and resistance to change and inhibit future adaptation.
There are many Polaroids out there. A great set of adaptations that ultimately inhibited responses to changing circumstances. 
Firms employ many techniques such as benchmarking to identify opportunities for change but introducing change is as Machiavelli (1469-1527) observed:
- “It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out nor more doubtful of success nor more dangerous to handle than to initiate a new order of things; for the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order; this lukewarmness arising partly from the incredulity of mankind who does not truly believe in anything new until they actually have experience of it.”
# Richard R. Nelson, Sidney G. Winter, “Evolutionary Theorizing in Economics”…
Nelson and Winter describe “Schumpeterian competition” as
evolutionary behavior:
Schumpeter was particularly interested in cases where change was driven by technological innovations  (creative destruction)
In models where internally generated innovation resulted in greater profitability and a cycle of innovation-driven profitability, there is a tendency toward concentration
When the technological innovations come from outside the industry, the tendency toward concentration is eliminated or greatly reduced
A distinction is drawn between “science-based” and “cumulative” innovation.
Science-based innovation tends to be external and offers no particular firm-specific advantage
Cumulative innovation tends to favor firms with well-funded and effective in-house R&D 
# Richard R. Nelson, Sidney G. Winter, “Evolutionary Theorizing in Economics”…
The dominant design model of industry life cycles involves:
A new, unsettled technology stimulates a number of different views on how best to achieve its benefits
An early period of high levels of entry with many different models
Firms continue to enter and try new approaches, failed attempts exit (a high level of variety remains)
Eventually methods and approaches converge on a dominant design
Thereafter competition is less product-based and innovation efforts shift toward process improvement 
As some firms become significantly more efficient, the rate of exit increases and 
Finally a relatively few large firms remain
The dominant design model has been tested and has succeeded in explaining industry structure and evolution in a number of sectors
 
# Evolution of the Dominant Design
Klepper’s product life cycle 
# Richard R. Nelson, Sidney G. Winter, “Evolutionary Theorizing in Economics”…
Incumbents are more at risk when the change is external, science-driven, and changes the architecture of the system
Incumbents can often weather change that comes from within the industry, is of the cumulative sort, and affects components of the system
The power of foresight in explaining technological innovation is surprisingly weak or absent. (As Knight pointed out, we cannot systematically foretell the future. Or as Yogi Berra* said, “Prediction is difficult, especially of the future.”)
*Yogi is a Hall-of-Fame catcher and probably undoubtedly America’s finest philosopher 
# Richard R. Nelson, Sidney G. Winter, “Evolutionary Theorizing in Economics”…
Nelson and Winter isolate some common
characteristics of new technology paths:
A great deal of uncertainty prevails and expert opinions have a wide variance
Winners and losers usually don’t emerge until significant investments have been made in rival approaches
Anyone, in government or out, who believes they can consistently pick winners among emerging technologies is ignorant of the history of technology and innovation and incredibly arrogant
# Richard R. Nelson, Sidney G. Winter, “Evolutionary Theorizing in Economics”…
    Technological advance is often a source of creative destruction and growth and the process displays certain features: 
Many scholars view it as an evolutionary system
Industry structure and technology tend to co-evolve – rapid growth and progress, stable period, followed by concentration when the technology matures
Technology involves both artifacts (practice) and a body of understanding which, over time, tend to advance together
Efforts to define “innovation systems” are underway
 
# Richard R. Nelson, Sidney G. Winter, “Evolutionary Theorizing in Economics”
Evolutionary economic models are similar in many
respects to those used in biology:
In contrast to the analytical engines of neoclassical modeling, evolutionary models often seek to replicate or explain patterns and paths
In a subject which assumes that foresight is rare and usually flawed, it is difficult to build “predictive” models
In general, evolutionary economics is more open and amenable to outside science and approaches. But it is not much more so than other “new” branches such as behavioral and experimental economics.
The rejection of the neoclassical assumptions of highly rational behavior and foresight accounts for most of the openness to other disciplines.
