# The Economics of Business
# Review
Coase said, “it is difficult to say whether ‘diminishing returns to management’ or the rising supply price of factors is likely to be the most important [constraint on firm size]”
Other things being equal, therefore, a firm will tend to be larger:
- (a) the less the costs of organizing and the slower these costs rise with an increase in the transactions organized
- (b) the less likely the entrepreneur is to make mistakes and the smaller the increase in mistakes with an increase in the transactions organized.
- (c) the greater the lowering (or the less the rise) in the supply price of factors of production to firms of larger size  
# Review
Which major technologies of the mid to late 19th century tended, ceteris paribus, to increase firm size?
- Railroads
- Telegraphs
- Reapers
Which technologies of the 2oth century tended, ceteris paribus, to increase firm size?
Coase said, “All changes which improve managerial techniques will tend to increase the size of the firm.”
- What examples  of improved managerial techniques can you identify?*
- How many involve efforts to reduce transactions costs? 
# Review
Alchian and Demsetz wrote, “Resource owners increase productivity through cooperative specialization and this leads to the demand for economic organizations which facilitate cooperation.”
- Is this consistent with Coase’s emphasis on hierarchy?
- What means are employed to facilitate cooperation among resource owners?
- How would you evaluate the degree of cooperation in an organization?
# Review
George Stigler noted, “Broadly viewed, Smith’s theorem suggests that vertical disintegration is the typical development in growing industries, vertical integration in declining industries.”
- Can you identify any examples of disintegration?
- How does the notion of modularity* in technical markets relate to vertical integration? To Jewkes’ notions of integration?
- What might account for the observed reluctance of high tech firms to operate throughout their value or supply chain?
# The Enigma of the Entrepreneur
Most Many economists believe that the entrepreneur is a critical factor in economic growth and development
Oddly, the standard neoclassical model is anchored by the concept of general equilibrium that has no place for the entrepreneur
- All equations are solved, no room for an entrepreneur to identify an opportunity and disrupt the equilibrium
Though many prominent economists have studied the entrepreneur, there is no commonly accepted definition
The lack of a precise definition and therefore measure of entrepreneurial activity handicaps analysis and policy advice  
# The Search for the Heffalump
Peter Kilby has likened the search for the 
- entrepreneur to that of the mysterious and notorious Heffalump.
Economists and other social scientists emphasize the features that interest them and reflect their research
We search for Heffalumps for three main reasons
- Science of human behavior: why and how do some people take an active and often imaginative role in our economy?
- Public policy: how can we nurture and promote behavior that stimulates growth and improvement in the human condition?
- Strategic insights: the entrepreneur displays many of the characteristics we seek in business strategy
# During the Financial Crisis The U.S. was Losing Firms Faster Than it Could Create Them
# Is the Heffalump Endangered?
Many people are concerned that entrepreneurs are an endangered species
- 2013 WSJ article “Risk-Averse Culture Infects U.S. Workers, Entrepreneurs” 
- 2014 Brookings study by Hathaway and Litan pointed to significant decline in rate of new business start-ups
- 2014 Prescott and Ohanian WSJ column, “Behind the Productivity Plunge: New businesses were created at a 30% lower rate in 2012 than the annual average rate in the 1980s” 
Some such as Scott Shane are more sanguine
- Rate of entrepreneurial activity tends to decline with increase in employment opportunities and wage rates
- Economic structures tend to evolve from basic agricultural state with high number of self-employed and small firms to greater proportion of significant firms
- Significant entrepreneurial initiatives today may require large corporate resources
- Stability and security of large firms relies on “technostructure” to manage areas formerly guided by entrepreneurs (J. K. Galbraith)
# Potential Explanations for Heffalump Decline
Opportunity cost of entrepreneurship may have increased relative to wages from employment
Barriers to entrepreneurship in the form of licensing, regulations and start up costs may have increased
“Animal Spirits” may have dimmed with increased uncertainty
Locus of entrepreneurial activity may have shifted to large firms
# Scott Shane Isn’t Very Worried
“Why Encouraging More People to Become Entrepreneurs is Bad Public Policy”
The “typical” entrepreneur is over-rated:
- The typical U.S. start-up is capitalized with about $25,000 of founder’s savings
- Most operate in the retail or personal services markets
- More than half are home-based
- Founders have moderate aspirations, generally around $100,000 in revenues in five years
- The vast majority of founders are not intent on founding new businesses so much as creating a self-employment, wage-substitution business
Shane argues that resources spent encouraging typical entrepreneurs are mis-spent
Emphasis should be on high potential, significant upside endeavors
- Targets of venture capitalists
- Small Business Innovation Research Program
- Small Business Investment Corporation (picking winners?) 
- But, are these top down sort of programs appropriate for bottom up phenomenon?
# An Album of Heffalump Pictures
“The entrepreneur is someone who specializes in taking responsibility for and making judgmental decisions that affect the location, form, and the use of resources, goods, or institutions.” Hébert and Link
- Coincident with management
- No mention of uncertainty 
The Bearer of Uncertainty About Demand and Supply – original conception by Richard Cantillon ~1750.
- Propulsion of the circular flow; change in time, place or form
- Inclusive, even beggars and thieves could be entrepreneurs
- The “Prince” was not an entrepreneur (probably for fear of offending the 18th century princes who were a sensitive and bloody lot)
# More Sightings…
The Division of Uncertainty Bearing Labor, implicit in Adam Smith’s notion of occupational choice – 1776
An Adventurer, “as necessary for the setting in motion of every class of industry whatever; that is to say, the application of acquired knowledge to the creation of a product for human consumption.” J.B. Say, 1855.  
- Say was among the first to define the activities and personal qualities of the entrepreneur
# More Sightings…
The Fourth Agent of Production, Alfred Marshall ~ 1890.
	- Marshal added business organization to the previous trinity of land, labor and capital thus recognizing the importance of the methods and guidance provided by entrepreneurs and executives
	- Marshall recognized three forms of “command over capital” - the supply of capital, the supply of the business power to manage that capital, and the supply of the organization by which the first two are brought together 
	- Entrepreneurship is often executed through new methods and organizations as Alfred Chandler showed in his study of the second Industrial Revolution

Actor Under Uncertainty, Frank Knight 1921
Very similar to Cantillon but more emphasis on the nature and consequences of making decisions under uncertainty
“With the introduction of uncertainty, -- the fact of ignorance and necessity of acting upon opinion rather than knowledge – into this Eden-like situation its character is completely changed. … With uncertainty present, doing things, the actual execution of activity, becomes in a real sense a secondary part of life; the primary problem is deciding what to do and how to do it.” (emphasis added)
# More…
Heroic Innovator or Innovation Factory – Joseph A. Schumpeter ~1911, 1931
Schumpeter advanced two visions of the entrepreneur
- Early work on development featured small, new firms that brought new ideas and combinations to the market, expanding the economy
- Later work on comparative economic structures emphasized the role of “creative destruction” in increasing productivity and redirecting resources to highest valued use
Schumpeter had a major although probably unintended influence on business strategy
- Peter Drucker was an apostle
- Current terms such as “disruptive technology” trace back to Schumpeterian visions
# Yet more…
The Missing Hamlet, William Baumol, 1968, pointed out that the standard neoclassical theory did not include an entrepreneurial role – like Hamlet without the Prince
- Economists had long noted that entrepreneurial capacity was the fixed factor that constrained ultimately the size of the firm – what Baumol referred to as the reason for the upward sloping cost curve.
- Baumol’s criticism is appreciated by the Austrian school who hold much the same view but welcome agreement from an eminent neoclassical economist
# Another one
Jack-of-All-Trades, Edward Lazear, 2003
Lazear studied the characteristics of Stanford MBAs who founded firms and noted that the most successful were those with broad backgrounds and educations.
“The view of entrepreneurship taken here is that it is the process of assembling necessary factors of production consisting of human, physical, and information resources and doing so in an efﬁcient manner. Entrepreneurs put people together in particular ways and combine them with physical capital and ideas to create a new product or to produce an existing one at a lower or competitive cost.” 
# Israel Kirzner’s Opportunist
Kirzner, like Schumpeter, Mises, Hayek, et al rejects the standard equilibrium model
Kirzner, sees the economy as a process of change and the entrepreneur as an agent of that change through a process of economic discovery
- At the beginning of each period, people make plans to produce or consume based on the imperfect knowledge they have
- As they execute their plans, they encounter one another and gain and share new information
- This new and unanticipated information gives rise to surprise and discovery that informs the next planning episode
- As the amount of information grows and is shared, the economy will tend to move in the direction of equilibrium 
- An active economy with continual new science, technology and resources probably doesn’t achieve a true equilibrium, only tending in that direction as more information is discovered and acted upon
- The entrepreneur is distinguished by his alertness to new opportunities revealed in the economy 
- Perhaps oddly, Kirzner’s entrepreneur may not be involved in the capture of the opportunity
# Hayek’s Concept of Information
Hayek is generally credited with the recognition of how information is created jointly and distributed throughout an economy
The organization of planning activities may be through individuals as in a capitalist market system or central planners as in a socialist system
Hayek noted that information is widely distributed and that people must learn and respond to a great deal of very specific and distributed information
- Unused space on a tramp steamer
- An underutilized machine
- Unoccupied dwellings
Such information is being continually generated and acted upon and changing the opportunities available
Modern examples of Hayek’s illustrations are Uber, MLS. Airbnb
Kirzner adopts the Hayekian concept of information as a source of entrepreneurial discovery 
# The Driving Force of the Economy
Kirzner was a student of Ludwig von Mises who, together with F. A. Hayek established the basis of the modern Austrian school*
Mises has had a tremendous affect on the school through his students and disciples but can be tedious and difficult to understand 
Mises sometimes came to the point clearly:
“The driving force of the market process is provided neither by the consumers nor by the owners of the means of production-land, capital goods, and labor-but by the promoting and speculating entrepreneurs . . . Profit- seeking speculation is the driving force of the market as it is the driving force of production. (Mises 1949, pp. 325-26) 
Kirzner argues that the profit-seeking speculation is guided by economic discovery
# Kirzner and Austrian Influence
The major post-war Austrian school economists were heavily involved in the debates over appropriate economic organization, most famously Hayek vs. Keynes.
Many modern economists felt the Austrians were too shrill in their promotion of free market capitalism over socialism and communism
War weary and exhausted Europeans sought a gentler economic model while trying to preserve some market forces (e.g. extended economic communities and eventually the European Union)
Regrettably, this yearning led in many cases to corporatism in which major issues are negotiated among firms, unions, and government. This is a major reason for the relative decline of economic dynamism in Europe.
Austrian school economists became viewed by many as hard-line right wingers (Mises was easy to caricature in this way)
The libertarian economic community has adopted many Austrian school approaches. Unfortunately, some so-called libertarians blindly reject social institutions and some are selfish blow-hards
Kirzner enjoys a wider influence because he is less confrontational and is more willing to strike a balance with the neoclassical perspective
Kirzner does however offer significantly different views on major policy issues.
# Kirzner and Austrian School Policy 
Anti-trust policy has traditionally been guided by the vision of intense competition among many players with, at most, modest market power
- This view is often hostile to mergers among peer firms
- Concentration is resisted and a host of arcane indices used to measure it
- Regulation is often advanced to temper market power – even if the firms are not true monopolists
- Robert Bork, a conservative judicial scholar and jurist was denied a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court in part because of his economic views arguing that traditional anti-trust actions harmed consumers by protecting inefficient producers
- Baumol’s theory of contestable markets pointed out that so long as entry and exit were free, potential entrants would police prices
- The Austrians argue that by denying the execution of profit-seeking behavior, competition is reduced.                                                                                                        
# Economic Justice
Economic justice is a sensitive topic. John Rawls, a leading moral philosopher and advocate of economic justice starts his book:
- Each person possesses an inviobility founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom of some is made right by a greater good shared by others. It does not allow that the sacrifices imposed on a few are outweighed by the larger sum of advantages enjoyed by many…In a just society the rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or the calculus of social interests
****
Rawls concludes that inequality in after-tax, after-subsidy wages is just to to the extent –that the wage gap- is precisely wide enough to deliver the maximum remuneration to the lowest earners.
# Fairness
Many critics of capitalist systems see them as exploitive and “unfair”
Critics focus on “redistribution” and “non-property rights”
Enough bad actors to provide examples, usually aided by market imperfections (inability to discover information or to act on it)
Economic discovery concept stresses the identification and creation of new wealth
Many people accept as “just” enormous fortunes earned by entrepreneurs because they recognize their role in creating new wealth and claim on a share
# Kirzner and Austrian School Policy 
Traditional welfare policy generally deals with the amount of wealth as a given and addresses how best to distribute it so as to maximize social welfare
The basic criterion for traditional welfare maximization is Pareto optimization in which a given amount of wealth is distributed until no one can be made better off without someone being made worse off
Kirzner points out that traditional welfare economics is a static concept and does not accommodate the capacity to create new wealth
Excessive redistribution can stifle entrepreneurship and reduce the egg-laying capacity of the golden goose 
# Kirzner and Austrian School Policy …
“The socialist calculation problem” raged in the inter-war and early post-WWII years as nations struggled with how to organize their economies
Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner were prominent economists who argued that in theory a well-informed planning board could achieve competitive market results without the need for greedy capitalists (market socialism)
Socialist economists advanced a sort of iterative process in which planners set prices and quantities and then observed the incidence of surpluses and shortages
The Austrians were particularly effective in exposing the inaccurate assumptions and misleading characterization of market processes used by the socialist modelers
In particular, central planning suppresses the creation of local information and prohibits its exploitation by entrepreneurs. 
More recently, some economists have argued that modern data and communication technology can overcome the information problem emphasized by Hayek and Mises
